```

### **Key Services**
- **AuthService** - Authentication and token management
- **JobsService** - Job operations and API integration
- **React Query** - Data fetching, caching, and synchronization

## 🔗 **BACKEND INTEGRATION**

### **API Endpoints Used**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/today` - Today's jobs for technician
- `PUT /api/v1/jobs/:id/start` - Start job
- `PUT /api/v1/jobs/:id/complete` - Complete job
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/:id` - Job details

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User enters credentials on login screen
2. App calls backend login endpoint
3. Backend returns JWT token and user data
4. Token stored securely in AsyncStorage
5. All subsequent API calls include Bearer token
6. Automatic token refresh and logout on expiration
