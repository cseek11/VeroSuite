# VeroField Development Rules for Cursor AI

This file serves as the main entry point for Cursor rules. Rules are organized into modular files for better maintainability and context scoping.

## Modular Rule Structure

Rules are split into domain-specific files located in `.cursor/rules/`:

**CRITICAL Priority:**
- **enforcement.md** - Rule enforcement and compliance (READ FIRST)
- **core.md** - Core philosophy, date/time handling, code quality standards, prohibited actions
- **security.md** - Security standards, tenant isolation, RLS policies
- **naming-consistency.md** - Project naming consistency (VeroField)
- **monorepo.md** - Monorepo structure and microservices
- **state-integrity.md** - State machine integrity and transitions
- **contracts.md** - Data contract consistency and schema versioning
- **dependencies.md** - Dependency governance and safety
- **database-integrity.md** - Transaction safety and data integrity
- **layer-sync.md** - UI/Backend layer synchronization
- **architecture-scope.md** - Architectural decision autonomy limits
- **ai-behavior.md** - AI behavior directives, tool usage strategy, implementation workflow
- **forms.md** - Form patterns, validation rules, dialog/modal patterns
- **frontend.md** - Frontend component rules, import patterns, code organization
- **error-resilience.md** - Error handling and silent failure elimination
- **observability.md** - Structured logging and traceability
- **pattern-learning.md** - Error pattern memory and engineering decisions
- **predictive-prevention.md** - Predictive guardrails and failure mode mapping

**HIGH Priority:**
- **performance.md** - Performance budgets and efficiency
- **eventing.md** - Message queue and event consistency
- **cross-platform.md** - Cross-platform resilience
- **accessibility.md** - Accessibility enforcement (WCAG AA)
- **tooling.md** - Tooling consistency and lockfile protection
- **refactoring.md** - Refactor integrity and behavior preservation
- **backend.md** - Backend architecture, module structure, database safety
- **veroai.md** - VeroAI development patterns
- **docs.md** - Documentation standards, update propagation rules
- **verification.md** - Automated verification checks, CI integration
- **ownership.md** - File ownership and domain boundaries

**NORMAL-HIGH Priority:**
- **ux-consistency.md** - UI/UX coherence and interaction rules
- **tech-debt.md** - Project health and tech debt logging

**NORMAL Priority:**
- **styling.md** - Styling guidelines, UI patterns

## Quick Reference

For the complete rules, Cursor will automatically load all files from `.cursor/rules/` directory. The rules are prioritized as follows:

1. **CRITICAL** - Core philosophy, security, tenant isolation, date/time handling
2. **HIGH** - Component usage, form patterns, code organization
3. **NORMAL** - Styling, documentation formatting

## Core Principles

- **Reuse > Reinvent** - Always search first!
- **Parallel > Sequential** - Use multiple tools simultaneously
- **Pattern > Custom** - Follow established conventions
- **Security > Speed** - Maintain tenant isolation
- **Documentation > Code** - Keep docs current with date/time

## Documentation References

- `AI_CONSISTENCY_PROTOCOL.md` - Component reuse and pattern matching
- `DEVELOPMENT_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Complete best practices guide
- `COMPONENT_LIBRARY_CATALOG.md` - Available reusable components
- `AI_ASSISTANT_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - AI development guidelines
- `DATABASE.md` - Database schema and RLS policies
- `API.md` - API endpoints and patterns
- `SECURITY_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Security best practices
