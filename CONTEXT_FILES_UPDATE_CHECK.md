## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check if Update Function is Called

**Check logs for:**
- "Context recommendations updated" message
- "Failed to update context recommendations" warnings
- Any exceptions in `_update_context_recommendations()`

### Step 2: Check Changed Files Detection

**Verify:**
- `get_changed_files()` returns non-empty list
- Git commands are working
- Files are being detected correctly

### Step 3: Check File Generation

**Verify:**
- File write permissions
- Directory exists (`.cursor/context_manager/`, `.cursor/rules/`)
- No exceptions during file write

### Step 4: Check Workflow Tracker

**Verify:**
- `add_task()` is being called
- `_save_state()` is being called after `add_task()`
- No exceptions during state save
