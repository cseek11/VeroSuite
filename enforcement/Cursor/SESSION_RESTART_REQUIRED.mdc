**Last Updated:** 2025-12-02T06:29:49.755891+00:00

## Core Context Has Changed

The following rule files have been created or deleted:

**Created:**
- C:\Users\ashse\Documents\VeroField\Training\VeroField\.cursor\enforcement\rules\context\context-schema_prisma.mdc

**Deleted:**
- None

## Action Required

**Cursor requires a new chat session to load updated rule files.**

### How to Restart Session:

1. **Start New Chat** (Recommended):
   - Click the **"+"** button in Cursor chat panel
   - Or use keyboard shortcut: **Cmd/Ctrl + N** (new chat)
   - This will load all updated rule files automatically

2. **Reload Window** (Alternative):
   - Use **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P** to open command palette
   - Type "Reload Window" and select it
   - This reloads the entire Cursor window

### Why Restart Is Needed:

- Rule files are loaded at session start
- Core context changes require rule file reload
- New session ensures all context is up-to-date

### Current Session Behavior:

- You can continue in current session, but context may be stale
- Agent will warn about missing/outdated context
- New session recommended for best results

**This alert will be removed automatically after 5 minutes or when new session detected.**
