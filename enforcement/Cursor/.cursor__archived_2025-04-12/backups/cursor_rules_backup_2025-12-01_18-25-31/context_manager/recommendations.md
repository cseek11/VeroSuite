## Current Task

- **Type:** edit_code
- **Files:** 100 file(s) modified
- **File Types:** .example, .py, .ts, .md, .yml, .cjs, .js, .yaml, .mdc, .pyc, .json

## Predicted Next Steps

1. run_tests (74% confidence) - Common transition pattern
2. write_docs (14% confidence) - Common transition pattern
3. review_code (12% confidence) - Common transition pattern

## Recommended Context

### Active Context (Currently Loaded)

- `@.cursor/rules/python_bible.mdc` (PRIMARY - REQUIRED)
- `@.cursor/rules/02-core.mdc` (PRIMARY - REQUIRED)

### Suggested Context (Optional - Not Loaded)

These files are suggested but NOT automatically loaded. Load manually if needed:

- `@.cursor/rules/08-backend.mdc` (OPTIONAL - Load manually if needed)
- `@.cursor/patterns/**/*.md` (OPTIONAL - Load manually if needed)
- `@.cursor/rules/07-observability.mdc` (OPTIONAL - Load manually if needed)

### Pre-loaded Context (Ready for Next Tasks)

- `@.cursor/rules/10-quality.mdc` (HIGH - Pre-loaded for predicted task)
- `@.cursor/rules/14-verification.mdc` (HIGH - Pre-loaded for predicted task)

## Context Efficiency Metrics

- **Active Context Files:** 2
- **Pre-loaded Context Files:** 2
- **Context to Unload:** 3
- **Predictions Used:** run_tests (74%)
- **Workflow Position:** 1 task(s) completed

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Context Management Requirements

**CRITICAL:** The AI agent MUST follow these requirements at EVERY task start and end.

### Step 0.5: Context Loading (Task Start - MANDATORY)

**BEFORE starting ANY task (after Step 0, before Step 1), the AI agent MUST:**

1. **MUST** read this recommendations file (`.cursor/context_manager/recommendations.md`)
2. **MUST** check `.cursor/context_manager/dashboard.md` for current workflow status
3. **MUST** load ALL files in "Active Context (Currently Loaded)" section using `@` mentions
4. **MUST** verify context is loaded before proceeding to Step 1
5. **MUST** show evidence of context loading in response

**Required Output Format:**
```
Step 0.5 Verification:
✓ Read recommendations.md: [summary]
✓ Loaded PRIMARY context:
  - @file1.md
  - @file2.md
✓ Context ready for task
✓ Ready to proceed to Step 1: YES
```

### Step 4.5: Context Management (Task End - MANDATORY)

**AFTER completing ANY task (after Step 4, before Step 5), the AI agent MUST:**

1. **MUST** read this recommendations file again (context may have changed)
2. **MUST** unload files in "Context to Unload" section (remove `@` mentions)
3. **MUST** pre-load files in "Pre-loaded Context" section (if probability >70%)
4. **MUST** show evidence of context management in response

**Required Output Format:**
```
Step 4.5 Verification:
✓ Read updated recommendations.md: [summary of changes]
✓ Unloaded obsolete context:
  - @old-file1.md (no longer needed)
✓ Pre-loaded predicted context:
  - @next-file1.md (87% confidence)
✓ Context state updated
✓ Ready to proceed to Step 5: YES
```

### Failure to Comply

**HARD STOP:** If the agent does not:
- Read this file at task start/end
- Load required PRIMARY context files
- Unload obsolete context files
- Pre-load predicted context files

**Then:** Task execution is BLOCKED until context management is completed.

## Context Management Actions

### At Task Start (Step 0.5):

**YOU MUST:**
1. Read this recommendations file (`.cursor/context_manager/recommendations.md`)
2. Load ALL files in "Active Context (Currently Loaded)" section using `@` mentions
3. Verify context is loaded before proceeding to Step 1
4. Show evidence of context loading in your response

**Example:**
```
✓ Read recommendations.md
✓ Loaded PRIMARY context:
  - @python_bible.md
  - @03-security.mdc
✓ Context ready for task
```

### At Task End (Step 4.5):

**YOU MUST:**
1. Read this recommendations file again (context may have changed)
2. Unload files in "Context to Unload" section (remove `@` mentions)
3. Pre-load files in "Pre-loaded Context" section (if probability >70%)
4. Show evidence of context management in your response

**Example:**
```
✓ Read updated recommendations.md
✓ Unloaded obsolete context:
  - @old-file.md (no longer needed)
✓ Pre-loaded predicted context:
  - @next-file.md (87% confidence)
✓ Context state updated
```

### Context to Unload

- `@.cursor/rules/python_bible.md` - **REMOVE @ mention**
- `@libs/common/prisma/schema.prisma` - **REMOVE @ mention**
- `@.cursor/rules/02-core.md` - **REMOVE @ mention**

## Failure to Comply

**HARD STOP:** If you do not:
- Read this file at task start/end
- Load required PRIMARY context files
- Unload obsolete context files
- Pre-load predicted context files

**Then:** Task execution is BLOCKED until context management is completed.
