# Context Enforcement Rules (Auto-Generated)

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Context Management Requirements

**CRITICAL:** The AI agent MUST follow these requirements at EVERY task start and end.

### Task Start Requirements (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE starting ANY task, the AI agent MUST:**

1. **MUST** read `.cursor/context_manager/recommendations.md` (use `read_file` tool)
2. **MUST** check `.cursor/context_manager/dashboard.md` for current workflow status
3. **MUST** load PRIMARY context files using `@` mentions:
   - Load all files listed in "Active Context (Currently Loaded)" section
   - Use format: `@filename` or `@path/to/file`
4. **MUST** verify context is loaded before proceeding to Step 1
5. **MUST** log context loading actions in response

**VERIFICATION:** Agent must show evidence of:
- Reading recommendations.md
- Loading primary context files
- Confirming context is ready

### Task End Requirements (MANDATORY)

**AFTER completing ANY task (before Step 5 audit), the AI agent MUST:**

1. **MUST** read `.cursor/context_manager/recommendations.md` again (context may have changed)
2. **MUST** unload context files that are no longer needed:
   - Check "Context to Unload" section in recommendations
   - Remove `@` mentions for files no longer relevant
3. **MUST** pre-load context for predicted next tasks (if probability >70%):
   - Load files from "Pre-loaded Context" section
   - Use format: `@filename` or `@path/to/file`
4. **MUST** update context state in response
5. **MUST** log context unloading/pre-loading actions

**VERIFICATION:** Agent must show evidence of:
- Reading updated recommendations.md
- Unloading obsolete context
- Pre-loading predicted context
- Confirming context state updated

### Context Loading Format

**Required format for context loading/unloading:**

```
## Context Management Actions

### Task Start (Step 0.5):
✓ Read recommendations.md: [summary]
✓ Loaded PRIMARY context:
  - @file1.md
  - @file2.md
✓ Context ready for task

### Task End (Step 4.5):
✓ Read updated recommendations.md: [summary]
✓ Unloaded obsolete context:
  - @old-file1.md (no longer needed)
✓ Pre-loaded predicted context:
  - @next-file1.md (87% confidence)
✓ Context state updated
```

## Context Priorities

This file is automatically generated by the Predictive Context Management System.
It provides dynamic context priorities based on current workflow predictions.

### Primary Context (High Priority) - LOAD THESE NOW

These files MUST be loaded with high priority for the current task:

- `.cursor/rules/python_bible.mdc` - **REQUIRED: Load with @ mention**
- `.cursor/rules/02-core.mdc` - **REQUIRED: Load with @ mention**

### Pre-loaded Context (Medium Priority) - LOAD FOR NEXT TASKS

These files should be pre-loaded for predicted next tasks (load if probability >70%):

- `.cursor/rules/10-quality.mdc` - **PRE-LOAD: Load with @ mention**
- `.cursor/rules/14-verification.mdc` - **PRE-LOAD: Load with @ mention**

### Context to Unload - REMOVE THESE

These files should be unloaded (no longer needed for current/predicted tasks):

- `.cursor/rules/python_bible.md` - **UNLOAD: Remove @ mention**
- `libs/common/prisma/schema.prisma` - **UNLOAD: Remove @ mention**
- `.cursor/rules/02-core.md` - **UNLOAD: Remove @ mention**

## Integration with Enforcement Pipeline

**Step 0.5 (NEW): Context Loading (MANDATORY)**
- Inserted between Step 0 (Memory Bank) and Step 1 (Search & Discovery)
- Agent MUST complete context loading before proceeding to Step 1

**Step 4.5 (NEW): Context Management (MANDATORY)**
- Inserted between Step 4 (Implementation Plan) and Step 5 (Post-Implementation Audit)
- Agent MUST complete context unloading/pre-loading before Step 5

## Failure to Comply

**HARD STOP:** If agent does not:
- Read recommendations.md at task start/end
- Load required PRIMARY context files
- Unload obsolete context files
- Pre-load predicted context files

**Then:** Task execution is BLOCKED until context management is completed.
