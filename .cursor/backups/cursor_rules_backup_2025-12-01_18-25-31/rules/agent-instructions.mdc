## GLOBAL BEHAVIOR (ALWAYS ACTIVE)

You ALWAYS operate using:

- **00-master.mdc** — master law, CI/RewardScore, pattern system, precedence  
- **01-enforcement.mdc** — mandatory 5-step workflow  
- **02-core.mdc** — tech stack, dates, foundation rules  
- **03-security.mdc** — security dominance (RLS, tenant isolation, validation)  
- **04–14 domain rules** — selected by file path + globs (see ROUTING section below)
- **Pattern system** — golden patterns, anti-patterns, bug log  
- **Multi-agent logic** — agents.json routing
- **Reward Score discipline** — CI-driven scoring
- **Strict monorepo directory rules** — architecture boundaries

**You MUST refuse or stop any action that violates ANY `.mdc` rule.**

---

## ENFORCEMENT WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

For EVERY engineering action (refactor, fix, feature, test, doc, review) you MUST execute and output the following 5-step pipeline:

### Step 1: Search & Discovery (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **MUST** search for existing components: `codebase_search("How does [feature] work?")`
- [ ] **MUST** check component library: `read_file("docs/reference/COMPONENT_LIBRARY_CATALOG.md")`
- [ ] **MUST** find 2-3 similar implementations using `grep` and `codebase_search`
- [ ] **MUST** verify file location using `list_dir` and `glob_file_search`
- [ ] **MUST** read relevant documentation files
- [ ] **MUST** search `docs/error-patterns.md` for similar past issues
- [ ] **MUST** search `docs/engineering-decisions.md` for relevant decisions
- [ ] **MUST** identify all error-prone operations (external I/O, async/await, user input, parsing, cross-service, auth, caching, events, concurrency)
- [ ] **MUST** search for existing logging patterns in similar code
- [ ] **MUST** search for trace propagation implementations
- [ ] **MUST** search for state machine documentation (if stateful component)
- [ ] **MUST** search for contract definitions (if schema changes)
- [ ] **MUST** check for existing dependencies (if adding new dependency)
- [ ] **MUST** verify transaction requirements (if multi-step DB operations)
- [ ] **MUST** check layer synchronization needs (if touching any layer)
- [ ] **MUST** check for old naming (VeroSuite, @verosuite/*) in affected files
- [ ] **MUST** search Rego OPA Bible (`docs/reference/Rego_OPM_BIBLE/rego_opa_bible_compiled.ssm.md`) for best practices **ONLY if working with Rego/OPA files** (`**/*.rego`, `services/opa/**`)

**STOP if you haven't completed all searches above.**

### Step 2: Pattern Analysis (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **MUST** identify the pattern to follow from similar implementations
- [ ] **MUST** verify correct file path (check `.cursor/rules/04-architecture.mdc` for structure)
- [ ] **MUST** check if component should be in `ui/` (reusable) or feature-specific
- [ ] **MUST** verify import patterns match existing code
- [ ] **MUST** analyze identified risks from Step 1
- [ ] **MUST** check for known error patterns from `docs/error-patterns.md`
- [ ] **MUST** verify error handling patterns match existing codebase
- [ ] **MUST** check trace propagation patterns
- [ ] **MUST** evaluate whether similar risks exist and plan guardrails
- [ ] **MUST** verify state machine pattern matches existing implementations (if stateful)
- [ ] **MUST** verify contract patterns match existing implementations (if schema changes)
- [ ] **MUST** verify dependency patterns match existing code (if adding dependency)
- [ ] **MUST** verify transaction patterns match existing code (if multi-step DB operations)
- [ ] **MUST** verify layer synchronization patterns (if touching any layer)

**STOP if pattern is unclear - ask for clarification.**

### Step 3: Rule Compliance Check (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **MUST** verify tenant isolation if touching database
- [ ] **MUST** check if using correct file paths (see `.cursor/rules/04-architecture.mdc`)
- [ ] **MUST** verify using shared libraries from `libs/common/` when:
  - Code is reusable across ≥2 apps/services within `apps/`
  - Logic is domain-agnostic (auth, validation, types, utilities)
  - Pattern already exists in `libs/common/` for similar functionality
  - NOT applicable for: app-specific business logic, UI components, one-off features
  - **Decision aid:** If you're copying code between apps, it belongs in shared libs
- [ ] **MUST** use current system date (check device date) - NEVER hardcode dates ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **MUST** verify structured logging requirements met
- [ ] **MUST** verify trace ID propagation present
- [ ] **MUST** verify error handling blocks present for all error-prone operations
- [ ] **MUST** check for silent failures (empty catch blocks, swallowed promises, missing awaits)
- [ ] **MUST** verify security event logging when:
  - Authentication or authorization logic changed
  - PII or sensitive data modified (always log)
  - PII or sensitive data accessed in privileged contexts (admin, security diagnostics)
  - Security policies (RLS, permissions, roles) changed
  - Admin actions performed (impersonation, privilege escalation)
  - Financial transactions processed
  - NOT applicable for: anonymous public endpoints, static asset serving
  - **Critical:** Log metadata only, never raw PII values (SOC2/privacy compliance)
- [ ] **MUST** verify no architecture changes without permission
- [ ] **MUST** verify no old naming (VeroSuite, @verosuite/*) introduced
- [ ] **MUST** verify performance characteristics analyzed
- [ ] **MUST** verify event schemas validated (if producing/consuming events)
- [ ] **MUST** verify cross-platform compatibility when:
  - Code touches mobile app (`VeroFieldMobile/`)
  - Shared code used by web + mobile
  - File system operations (path separators, case sensitivity)
  - Date/time handling (timezone, locale, formatting)
  - Network requests (connectivity checks, offline handling, API retries)
  - Platform-specific APIs used (localStorage vs AsyncStorage)
  - Third-party library usage that may not have platform parity
  - Push notification logic (mobile-only features)
  - Feature flags used by both platforms
  - NOT applicable for: web-only features, backend-only code, platform-abstracted code
- [ ] **MUST** verify accessibility requirements met (if UI component)
- [ ] **MUST** verify tooling compliance (lint/format, TypeScript)
- [ ] **MUST** verify Rego/OPA formatting **ONLY if working with Rego/OPA files**: Run `opa fmt --write` immediately after generating or modifying any `.rego` files ⭐ **CRITICAL** (see Rego OPA Bible Chapter 2.3)
- [ ] **MUST** verify refactor integrity (if refactoring)
- [ ] **MUST** verify UX consistency (if UI component)
- [ ] **MUST** verify file ownership respected
- [ ] **MUST** verify tech debt logged when:
  - TODO/FIXME comments representing deferred work or technical shortcuts
  - Workarounds or temporary solutions implemented
  - Known limitations introduced that affect users
  - Performance optimizations deferred (with measurable impact)
  - **Triage rule:** If removing the TODO would require >2 hours OR create risk if forgotten, log it
  - NOT applicable for: Trivial cleanup TODOs, refactoring notes, completed work markers
- [ ] **MUST** verify file organization compliance
- [ ] **MUST** verify workflow triggers are properly configured (if modifying workflows)

**STOP if any rule violation detected.**

### Step 4: Implementation Plan (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **MUST** create todo list for complex features (>3 steps)
- [ ] **MUST** explain what you found in searches
- [ ] **MUST** describe the pattern you'll follow
- [ ] **MUST** list files you'll create/modify

**STOP if plan is not clear.**

### Step 4.5: Immediate Bug Documentation (MANDATORY) ⭐ **CRITICAL**

**AFTER fixing ANY bug (including test failures), you MUST IMMEDIATELY document it. DO NOT WAIT until Step 5.**

#### What Counts as a "Bug Fix"?

**ALWAYS counts as bug fix (MUST document):**
- Fixing failing tests (test code bugs)
- Fixing incorrect test assertions
- Fixing incorrect production code
- Fixing incorrect configuration
- Fixing incorrect documentation
- Fixing incorrect regex patterns
- Fixing incorrect type definitions
- Fixing incorrect error handling
- Fixing incorrect imports or dependencies

**Does NOT count as bug fix:**
- Adding new features (not fixing broken code)
- Refactoring working code (not fixing bugs)
- Adding tests for new features (not fixing broken tests)
- Updating documentation for new features (not fixing incorrect docs)

**Rule of thumb:** If code/test was WRONG and you FIXED it = BUG FIX

#### Immediate Documentation Checklist (Complete for EACH bug):

- [ ] **Bug identified and fixed**
- [ ] **BUG_LOG.md entry created IMMEDIATELY with:**
  - [ ] Date (current system date)
  - [ ] Area (component/service affected)
  - [ ] Description (what was broken, what was fixed)
  - [ ] Status (fixed)
  - [ ] Owner (AI Agent)
  - [ ] Notes (brief summary + link to error-patterns.md)
- [ ] **Error pattern documented (if criteria met):**
  - [ ] Root cause analysis
  - [ ] Triggering conditions
  - [ ] Fix implementation
  - [ ] Prevention strategies
  - [ ] Code examples (before/after)
- [ ] **Cross-references added:**
  - [ ] BUG_LOG.md links to error-patterns.md: `Related: docs/error-patterns.md#PATTERN_NAME`
  - [ ] error-patterns.md references BUG_LOG.md date: `Related: .cursor/BUG_LOG.md (YYYY-MM-DD)`
- [ ] **"Last Updated" dates updated** (if modified existing files)

#### Error Pattern Documentation Decision Tree

**Must document in error-patterns.md if ANY of these are true:**

1. **Root cause was non-obvious:**
   - Took >1 hour to diagnose? → DOCUMENT
   - Required deep debugging? → DOCUMENT
   - Not immediately obvious from error message? → DOCUMENT

2. **Prevention strategy exists:**
   - Can add documentation to prevent? → DOCUMENT
   - Can add code patterns to prevent? → DOCUMENT
   - Can add tests to prevent? → DOCUMENT

3. **Recurring pattern risk:**
   - Someone else could make same mistake? → DOCUMENT
   - Similar bugs occurred before? → DOCUMENT
   - Pattern could occur in other areas? → DOCUMENT

4. **Always document these:**
   - Security bugs → ALWAYS
   - Data corruption bugs → ALWAYS
   - Financial calculation errors → ALWAYS
   - Production incidents → ALWAYS

**Do NOT document if:**
- Simple typo (obvious fix)
- One-off edge case (won't recur)
- Obvious logic error (immediate fix)

**STOP and document bugs immediately - do not wait for Step 5.**

### Step 5: Post-Implementation Audit (MANDATORY) ⭐ **CRITICAL**

**IMPORTANT:** This is the general audit checklist. You MUST ALSO check domain-specific audit procedures from the rule files that apply to your changes (see ROUTING section above). Domain-specific procedures are found in:
- `03-security.mdc` - R01, R02, R12, R13 audit procedures
- `04-architecture.mdc` - R03, R21, R22 audit procedures
- `05-data.mdc` - R04, R05, R06 audit procedures
- `06-error-resilience.mdc` - R07 audit procedures
- `07-observability.mdc` - R08, R09 audit procedures
- `08-backend.mdc` - R11 audit procedures
- `09-frontend.mdc` - R24 audit procedures
- `10-quality.mdc` - R10, R16, R17, R18 audit procedures
- `11-operations.mdc` - R23, R25 audit procedures
- `12-tech-debt.mdc` - R14, R15 audit procedures
- `13-ux-consistency.mdc` - R19, R20 audit procedures

**General Audit Checklist (Applies to ALL changes):**

- [ ] **MUST** audit ALL files touched for code compliance
- [ ] **MUST** verify file paths are correct (monorepo structure)
- [ ] **MUST** verify imports use correct paths (`@verofield/common/*`)
- [ ] **MUST** verify no old naming (VeroSuite, @verosuite/*) remains
- [ ] **MUST** verify tenant isolation (if database queries)
- [ ] **MUST** verify file organization compliance
- [ ] **MUST** verify date compliance (current system date, not hardcoded)
- [ ] **MUST** verify following established patterns
- [ ] **MUST** verify no duplicate components created
- [ ] **MUST** verify TypeScript types are correct (no `any`)
- [ ] **MUST** verify security boundaries maintained
- [ ] **MUST** verify documentation updated with current date
- [ ] **MUST** verify all error paths have tests
- [ ] **MUST** verify logging meets structured logging policy
- [ ] **MUST** verify no silent failures remain
- [ ] **MUST** verify observability hooks present (trace IDs, structured logs)
- [ ] **MUST** verify tests pass (regression + preventative)
- [ ] **MUST** verify cross-layer traceability intact (traceId, spanId, requestId propagated)
- [ ] **MUST** verify workflow triggers validated (if workflows modified)
- [ ] **MUST** verify Rego files formatted **ONLY if Rego/OPA files were modified**: Run `opa fmt --write` and verify all `.rego` files are formatted ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **MUST** verify bug logged in `.cursor/BUG_LOG.md` for EACH bug fixed ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **MUST** verify error pattern documented in `docs/error-patterns.md` for applicable bugs ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **MUST** verify cross-references exist between BUG_LOG.md and error-patterns.md ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **MUST** verify anti-pattern logged in `.cursor/anti_patterns.md` (if REWARD_SCORE ≤ 0) ⭐ **CRITICAL**

**Domain-Specific Audit Procedures:**

- [ ] **MUST** check and complete relevant audit procedures from domain rule files based on file paths changed:
  - **Security changes** (auth, RLS, PII) → Check `03-security.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R01, R02, R12, R13)
  - **Architecture changes** (monorepo, service boundaries) → Check `04-architecture.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R03, R21, R22)
  - **Data changes** (schema, DTOs, state machines) → Check `05-data.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R04, R05, R06)
  - **Error handling changes** → Check `06-error-resilience.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R07)
  - **Observability changes** (logging, tracing) → Check `07-observability.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R08, R09)
  - **Backend changes** → Check `08-backend.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R11)
  - **Frontend changes** → Check `09-frontend.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R24)
  - **Testing changes** → Check `10-quality.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R10, R16, R17, R18)
  - **CI/CD changes** → Check `11-operations.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R23, R25)
  - **Tech debt changes** → Check `12-tech-debt.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R14, R15)
  - **UX changes** → Check `13-ux-consistency.mdc` Step 5 procedures (R19, R20)

**STOP if any compliance violation found - fix before proceeding.**

### Output Deliverables (After Pipeline)

After completing the 5-step pipeline, provide:

1. **Code implementation**
2. **Tests** (unit, integration, regression as applicable)
3. **Documentation changes**
4. **DRAFT Reward Score** (if no CI RS available)

**If ANY step cannot be completed → HARD STOP.**

---

## ROUTING & MODE SELECTION (FILE PATH-BASED)

Automatically route and load rules based on file paths/globs. Routing is **additive** (multiple rules can apply simultaneously).

### Always Include (Universal)

- General patterns (`.cursor/patterns/*`)
- Security rules (`.cursor/prompts/security_review.md`)
- Testing rules (`.cursor/prompts/tester.md`) if code changed

### Path-Based Routing

#### Backend Files
**Paths:** `apps/*/src/**/*.ts`, `libs/common/**/*.ts`, `backend/`, `src/api/`, `src/services/`, `*.ts`, `*.py`, `*.go`

**Load Rules:**
- `08-backend.mdc` (NestJS, Prisma patterns)
- `06-error-resilience.mdc` (Error handling)
- `07-observability.mdc` (Logging, tracing)

**Load Prompt:** `.cursor/prompts/backend_reviewer.md`

#### Frontend Files
**Paths:** `frontend/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, `VeroFieldMobile/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, `src/components/`, `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`

**Load Rules:**
- `09-frontend.mdc` (React/React Native architecture)
- `13-ux-consistency.mdc` (UI/UX coherence)

**Load Prompt:** `.cursor/prompts/frontend_reviewer.md`

#### Infrastructure Files
**Paths:** `infra/`, `deploy/`, `k8s/`, `*.tf`, `.github/workflows/**`

**Load Rules:**
- `11-operations.mdc` (CI/CD, workflows)

**Load Prompt:** `.cursor/prompts/infra_reviewer.md`

#### Data/Contracts Files
**Paths:** `pipelines/`, `*.sql`, `airflow/`, analytics folders

**Load Rules:**
- `05-data.mdc` (Contracts, state machines, layer sync)

**Load Prompt:** `.cursor/prompts/distill_data.md` (if exists)

#### Test Files
**Paths:** `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.spec.ts`

**Load Rules:**
- `10-quality.mdc` (Testing, coverage, performance)
- `14-verification.mdc` (Verification & testing standards)

#### OPA/Rego Files
**Paths:** `services/opa/**/*.rego`, `**/*.rego`

**Load Rules:**
- Rego OPA Bible (`docs/reference/Rego_OPM_BIBLE/rego_opa_bible_compiled.ssm.md`) - **MANDATORY reference**
- `10-quality.mdc` (Testing, coverage, performance)
- `11-operations.mdc` (CI/CD, workflows)

**Special Requirements:**
- **MUST** run `opa fmt --write` immediately after generating/modifying Rego code (Bible Chapter 2.3)
- **MUST** use explicit namespaced references in tests (Bible Chapter 6, 7.2.1)
- **MUST** use raw strings (backticks) for multi-line content in tests (Bible Chapter 7.7.2)

### Default Routing

- If multiple areas match, load all relevant prompts (routing is additive)
- If no path matches, default to `@lead` prompt (`.cursor/prompts/lead_review.md`)

---

## ABSOLUTE SECURITY DOMINANCE

You MUST STOP if requested to:

- Bypass RLS
- Use tenantId from client
- Skip validation
- Hardcode secrets
- Query without tenant context
- Expose PII or stack traces
- Use raw SQL with string interpolation
- Remove auth or authorization

**These violations END execution immediately.**

**Security Rules (03-security.mdc) override all other rules if conflict occurs.**

---

## STRICT PROHIBITIONS (NEVER ALLOWED)

Never:

- Create new microservices (requires explicit human approval)
- Break monorepo structure
- Add dependencies without analysis
- Write JavaScript in source code (TypeScript only)
- Hardcode dates (MUST check current system date)
- Introduce silent errors
- Use console.log (use structured logging)
- Duplicate components
- Modify package.json without review
- Skip required tests
- Let UX drift from design system
- Create files in deprecated paths (`backend/src/` → use `apps/api/src/`)
- Use cross-service relative imports
- Bypass tenant isolation

---

## PATTERN SYSTEM (FILE STRUCTURE)

You MUST reference these specific files:

### Golden Patterns

- **`.cursor/patterns/`** — Golden pattern implementations (primary source)
- **`.cursor/golden_patterns.md`** — Pattern index + metadata
- **Pattern naming:** `NNN_domain_short-name.md` (e.g., `001_backend_circuit_breaker.md`)

### Anti-Patterns & Bug Log

- **`.cursor/anti_patterns.md`** — Known bad patterns (must avoid)
  - Log anti-patterns from low-score PRs (REWARD_SCORE ≤ 0)
  - Include: Date, PR, description, impact, follow-up
  
- **`.cursor/BUG_LOG.md`** — Historical bug patterns (prevent regressions)
  - **MANDATORY:** Log ALL bug fixes (concise tracking)
  - Include: Date, area, description, status, owner, notes
  - Must link to error-patterns.md entry
  
- **`docs/error-patterns.md`** — Detailed pattern knowledge base
  - **MANDATORY:** Document ALL bug fixes (detailed learning)
  - Include: Root cause, triggers, fixes, prevention, code examples
  - Must be cross-referenced from BUG_LOG.md

- **`.cursor/PYTHON_LEARNINGS_LOG.md`** — Python audit learnings
  - **MUST** reference when working with Python code (`*.py` files, Python audits, Python Bible compliance)
  - Log learnings from Python code audits and Python Bible compliance reviews
  - Include: Mistakes made, Python Bible references, actionable guidance, evidence
  - Reference: `.cursor/rules/python_bible.mdc` (enforcement rules) and `knowledge/bibles/python/cursor/Python_Bible.cursor.md` (knowledge base)

**Dual Requirement:** When fixing a bug, you MUST:
1. Log concise entry in `.cursor/BUG_LOG.md` **IMMEDIATELY** (do not wait for Step 5)
2. Document detailed pattern in `docs/error-patterns.md` **IMMEDIATELY** (if criteria met - see Step 4.5)
3. Cross-reference both files **IMMEDIATELY**

**Timing:** Complete bug documentation in Step 4.5 (immediately after fixing), then verify in Step 5.

### Pattern Rules

- Always reuse golden patterns from `.cursor/patterns/` before inventing new logic
- Detect and avoid anti-patterns from `.cursor/anti_patterns.md`
- Suggest pattern candidates via @coach mode (never auto-adopt)
- Patterns are authoritative only after human reviewer merges via PR
- Each pattern must include metadata (`created_at`, `author`, `source_pr`, `domain`, `complexity`)

### Pattern Extraction Triggers

- **High-score PR** (CI REWARD_SCORE ≥ 6) → eligible for pattern extraction
- **Low-score PR** (CI REWARD_SCORE ≤ 0) → generate anti-pattern suggestions
- **Manual invocation** via @coach mode

---

## REWARD SCORE SYSTEM

### Format (from 00-master.mdc)

```
REWARD_SCORE: X/10 (source: CI | DRAFT)
Breakdown:
tests: +3
bug_fix: +2
docs: +1
penalties: -2

Assessment:
<2–4 sentences>

Actionable Feedback:
- ...
- ...

Decision:
APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / BLOCK
```

### Thresholds & Actions

- **Score < -3** + failing tests/security issues → **BLOCK** and request changes
- **Score -3..3** → Require explicit `@lead` human review tag for merge
- **Score ≥ 6** → Eligible for pattern extraction (@coach mode)
- **Score ≤ 0** → Generate anti-pattern suggestions

### Source Priority

1. **CI-supplied REWARD_SCORE** (authoritative)
2. **Local analysis labeled `DRAFT`** (if CI not available)
3. **Use `.cursor/reward_rubric.yaml`** for scoring weights

**When reviewing or generating changes, compute DRAFT score if CI not available.**

---

## MULTI-AGENT MODEL (agents.json)

You route your reasoning through specialized agents based on context.

### Available Agents (from `.cursor/agents.json`)

- **Lead Review Agent** — Full PR-grade review, all rules
- **Security Auditor** — RLS, auth, secrets enforcement
- **Backend Reviewer** — NestJS, Prisma, DTOs, RLS
- **Frontend Reviewer** — React/RN, design system, UX consistency
- **Tester** — Regression/unit/integration/E2E test generation
- **Coach** — Pattern extraction, explanations, best practices
- **CI Workflow Auditor** — GitHub Actions, Reward Score pipelines
- **Monorepo Navigator** — File structure, service boundaries
- **Architecture Advisor** — High-level architectural correctness
- **Tech Debt Agent** — Modernization, cleanup, anti-pattern removal

### Routing Logic

- Automatically select agents based on file paths (see ROUTING section)
- Multiple agents can be active simultaneously (additive routing)
- Each agent loads its specific rule subset from 00-14 .mdc files

---

## ALWAYS SHOW WHAT RULES APPLY

When generating code, tests, or review output:

1. **Determine** which `.mdc` rules apply (based on file paths/globs)
2. **List** the specific rule files that informed your decision
3. **Highlight** any conflicts and obey highest precedence:
   - **00-master.mdc** (supreme precedence)
   - **01-enforcement.mdc** (mandatory pipeline)
   - **03-security.mdc** (security dominance)
4. **Reference** specific rule file sections when applicable

### Example Output

```
Rules Applied:
- 00-master.mdc (CI/RewardScore, pattern system)
- 01-enforcement.mdc (5-step pipeline)
- 03-security.mdc (tenant isolation, RLS)
- 08-backend.mdc (NestJS patterns) [via glob: apps/api/src/**/*.ts]
- 10-quality.mdc (testing requirements)
```

---

## EMERGENCY OVERRIDE

You ONLY bypass a rule if the user explicitly issues:

```
@emergency_override:<rule-id>:<YYYY-MM-DD>
```

### Rules

- Overrides expire automatically (max 7 days)
- Must be logged in `docs/architecture/cursor_rules_upgrade.md`
- Requires approval from Rules Champion
- Cannot exceed 7 days expiration

### Example

```
@emergency_override:04-architecture:2025-11-28
```

This pauses `04-architecture.mdc` until 2025-11-28.

---

## YOU MUST

- Enforce the entire Hybrid Rule System on EVERY action
- Stay within safe transformations unless user gives explicit scope
- NEVER perform destructive/structural operations unless explicitly asked
- Follow the 5-step enforcement pipeline for ALL code changes
- Show which rules apply for every output
- Use file path-based routing to load appropriate domain rules
- Reference specific pattern files (`.cursor/patterns/`, `.cursor/golden_patterns.md`, etc.)
- Compute DRAFT Reward Score if CI not available
- Apply REWARD_SCORE thresholds correctly (BLOCK < -3, REVIEW -3..3, etc.)
- Stop immediately on security violations
- Never hardcode dates (always check current system date)
- Never create silent failures
- Never bypass tenant isolation or RLS

---

## YOU MUST NOT

- Skip any step in the enforcement pipeline
- Create new microservices without explicit approval
- Use deprecated file paths (`backend/src/` → `apps/api/src/`)
- Hardcode dates, secrets, or tenant IDs
- Bypass security rules for convenience
- Auto-adopt patterns without human review
- Ignore REWARD_SCORE thresholds
- Create cross-service relative imports
- Use console.log instead of structured logging
- Generate Rego code without running `opa fmt` (MUST format immediately after generation)

---
