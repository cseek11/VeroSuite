# BUG LOG

| Date | Area | Description | Status | Owner | Notes |      
|------|------|-------------|--------|-------|-------|      
| 2025-11-17 | Frontend/Scheduling | REACT_QUERY_API_FETCH_ERROR - ResourceTimeline component missing error handling for React Query API fetch failures. Errors from enhancedApi.technicians.list, enhancedApi.users.list, and enhancedApi.jobs.getByDateRange were not caught and displayed to users, causing silent failures. | fixed | AI Agent | Fixed during implementation. Error pattern documented in docs/error-patterns.md. All errors now use structured logging (logger.error) and display user-friendly error messages. Regression tests added (4 error handling tests). |
| 2025-11-17 | Tooling/Auto-PR | MONITOR_CHANGES_DATETIME_PARSE_FAILURE - monitor_changes.py crashed when parsing timestamps with double timezone suffixes, preventing auto PR creation and causing missing state updates. | fixed | AI Agent | Fixed via docs/planning/MONITOR_CHANGES_BUG_FIX.md (safe parsing, timezone-aware comparisons). Regression tests completed (3 tests in test_monitor_changes.py). |
| 2025-11-18 | CI/Workflows | WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_SKIPPED - Reward score workflows were being skipped because they required CI to complete successfully. When CI failed, reward score workflows never ran, preventing scores from being computed and metrics from being collected. | fixed | AI Agent | Fixed by removing CI success requirement from workflow condition. Workflows now run even if CI fails (check event type instead of conclusion). Error pattern documented in docs/error-patterns.md. |
| 2025-11-18 | Tooling/Auto-PR | AUTO_PR_CONSOLIDATION_NOT_RUNNING - Auto-PR system was creating too many small PRs (50+) without consolidating them automatically. Consolidation logic existed but wasn't being triggered, and system didn't check for existing open PRs before creating new ones, leading to duplicate files across multiple PRs. | fixed | AI Agent | Fixed by adding automatic consolidation checks before PR creation, filtering files already in open PRs, improving consolidation logic to handle large PRs (uses additions/deletions as secondary sort key), and enabling self-healing when > max_open_prs exist. Error pattern documented in docs/error-patterns.md. |
| 2025-11-18 | Tooling/Auto-PR | TOO_MANY_SMALL_PRS - Auto-PR system created 50+ small PRs (1-10 files each) due to aggressive grouping logic that created one PR per directory. This overwhelmed the PR list and made it difficult to review changes. | fixed | AI Agent | Fixed by increasing thresholds (min_files: 5→10, min_lines: 200→500), disabling group_by_file_type, increasing max_group_size (10→50), adding min_group_size to combine small groups, and improving grouping logic to combine small groups instead of splitting. Configuration updated in .cursor/config/auto_pr_config.yaml. |
| 2025-11-18 | Tooling/Validation | YAML_ON_PARSED_AS_BOOLEAN - validate_workflow_triggers.py reported false positives for missing `on:` sections because YAML 1.1 parses `on:` as boolean `True` instead of string `"on"`. This caused all workflows to be incorrectly flagged as missing `on:` sections, even though they all had proper `on:` sections defined. | fixed | AI Agent | Fixed by converting `True` key back to `"on"` in `load_workflow_file()`, and updating `get_workflow_triggers()` and `check_has_on_section()` to handle both keys. Error pattern documented in docs/error-patterns.md. |
| 2025-11-18 | CI/Workflows | DASHBOARD_DOWNLOAD_FROM_SKIPPED_WORKFLOW - Dashboard update workflow was downloading artifacts from skipped reward score workflows instead of successful ones. This caused dashboard updates to fail because reward.json artifacts don't exist for skipped workflows, resulting in stale metrics and no dashboard updates. | fixed | AI Agent | Fixed by adding job-level condition `github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'` to dashboard workflow. Dashboard now only runs when reward score workflow succeeded, ensuring reward.json artifact is available. Error pattern documented in docs/error-patterns.md. |
