## Next Steps

### If You Have Current Session Violations (🔧):

1. **Auto-fix violations:**
   - Update hardcoded dates to current system date
   - Add missing error handling
   - Update "Last Updated" fields
   - Fix any other violations listed above

2. **Re-run enforcement:**
   ```bash
   python .cursor/scripts/auto-enforcer.py
   ```

3. **Verify fixes:**
   - Check that AGENT_STATUS.md shows COMPLIANT
   - Verify ENFORCEMENT_BLOCK.md is removed (no violations)

4. **Only then proceed** with your task

### If You Have Historical Violations (📋):

1. **List all violations** in your response
2. **Request human guidance** on how to proceed
3. **DO NOT proceed** until human provides guidance
4. **DO NOT auto-fix** historical violations without permission
