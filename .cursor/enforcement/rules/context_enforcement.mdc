**NOTE:** This file is generated by the enforcer (Brain A) for internal context management.
The LLM (Brain B) does not need to read or follow this file.

Context is automatically managed by the enforcer based on task requirements.
The LLM receives context hints in ENFORCER_REPORT.json when needed.

- No core context files.

### Dynamic Context (Load These - REQUIRED)

These files MUST be loaded with @ mentions for the current task:

- `.cursor/enforcement/rules/python_bible.mdc` - **REQUIRED: Load with @ mention**
- `.cursor/enforcement/rules/02-core.mdc` - **REQUIRED: Load with @ mention**

### Pre-loaded Context (Medium Priority) - LOAD FOR NEXT TASKS

These files should be pre-loaded for predicted next tasks (load if probability >70%):

- No pre-loaded context files.

### Context to Unload - REMOVE THESE

These files should be unloaded (no longer needed for current/predicted tasks):
