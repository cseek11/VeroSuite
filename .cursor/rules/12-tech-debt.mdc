# TECHNICAL DEBT & TODO/FIXME RULES

## PURPOSE
Ensure all technical debt is visible, logged, and has a remediation plan.

---

## TECH DEBT LOGGING
- All meaningful debt must be logged in `docs/tech-debt.md` with:
  - Category (code quality, performance, security, docs, testing, architecture, dependencies).
  - Location (file path).
  - Impact.
  - Remediation plan.
  - Estimated effort.
  - Status (open/resolved).

Dates must follow the dynamic date rules from `02-core.mdc` (no hardcoded historical dates).

---

## TODO/FIXME HANDLING
- AI must **search for** `TODO`/`FIXME` in touched areas.
- If a TODO/FIXME is resolved:
  - Remove the comment.
  - Update `docs/tech-debt.md` entry (mark as resolved).
  - Optionally add a brief comment explaining solution if non-obvious.

---

## REMEDIATION PLANS
For meaningful debt:
- Problem statement
- Root cause
- Impact
- Steps to fix
- Effort estimate
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Dependencies

---

## PIPELINE INTEGRATION

**Step 1:** Search for existing tech debt entries and TODO/FIXME markers.

**Step 3:** Check:
- New debt discovered is logged.
- Relevant TODO/FIXME items are addressed or updated.

**Step 5:** Confirm:
- No resolved TODO/FIXME left in code.
- Tech-debt log updated.

---

## VIOLATIONS (HARD STOP)
- Leaving TODO/FIXME after finishing a task.
- Introducing debt without logging it (when it's known).
- Using hardcoded dates in the tech-debt log.
