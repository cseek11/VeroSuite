# Enforcer-Specific Minimal Context Behavior

When the user is working on the Auto-Enforcer or its checkers:

1. Load ONLY:
   - The file currently opened in the editor.
   - The file explicitly referenced in the task.
   - Supporting checker modules if explicitly named.
   - No automatic loading of other enforcement modules.

2. DO NOT:
   - Auto-infer legacy checkers.
   - Load backend/frontend files.
   - Pull context from unrelated Python or TypeScript directories.
   - Expand context based on imports.

3. Maintain strict minimal-token output:
   - Use diffs or modified snippets only.
   - No explanation unless asked.
   - No back-and-forth questions unless required for correctness.

4. Ask only **once** if a required file is missing.

This rule overrides all other rules during enforcer tasks.
