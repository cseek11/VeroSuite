# Minimal Context Rule

Cursor MUST:

1. Load ONLY the following into context:
   - Files the user explicitly opens in the editor.
   - Files the user pastes or uploads into the chat.
   - Files explicitly listed in an Execution Contract.

2. DO NOT load:
   - Inferred dependencies.
   - Files referenced by keywords.
   - Cross-project modules.
   - Archived or legacy directories.
   - Context from unrelated folders.

3. Ask **once only** if a missing file or dependency is required.

4. Use the **minimum possible number of input/output tokens**:
   - No restating instructions.
   - No verbose reasoning.
   - No full-file rewrites unless explicitly required.
   - Prefer diffs and minimal snippets.

5. Avoid accumulating context over time:
   - Do not reload previously loaded files unless the user reopens them.
   - Do not infer cached context unless explicitly requested.

6. Stop output after completing the exact requested change.

This rule applies globally unless overridden by a task-specific rule.
