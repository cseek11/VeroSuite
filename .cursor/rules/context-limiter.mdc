# Context Limiter Rule

Cursor MUST restrict context loading using the following constraints:

1. Context Source Priority (highest → lowest):
   1. Files open in the editor.
   2. Files explicitly pasted by the user.
   3. Files listed in an Execution Contract.
   4. Nothing else.

2. Hard Limits:
   - DO NOT load context from unrelated folders.
   - DO NOT expand context based on imports or inferred dependencies.
   - DO NOT use cached conversation context unless explicitly referenced.
   - Limit reasoning to the minimum needed to complete the task.

3. Token Constraints:
   - Minimize input token usage.
   - Minimize output tokens.
   - Avoid unnecessary reasoning.
   - Avoid indirect references to entire modules.

4. Behavior:
   - If a required file is missing, ask ONCE.
   - Do not repeatedly re-request the same file.
   - Do not reload previously closed files.

This limiter applies globally to all tasks.
