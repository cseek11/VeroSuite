# Cursor Rules Index
# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This file is archived for Two-Brain Model
# 
# Two-Brain Model (Phase 2) Active:
# - Brain B (LLM): Only loads 3-4 lightweight files from .cursor/rules/
# - Brain A (Enforcer): Owns all heavy rules in .cursor/enforcement/rules/
#
# This file is kept for reference only. Cursor auto-discovers .mdc files.
# The actual rule loading is controlled by .cursorrules file.
#
# Version: 2.0 (deprecated)
# Project: VeroField
# Last Updated: 2025-11-21
# Archived: 2025-12-21 (Two-Brain Model migration)

# ⚠️ DO NOT USE: These paths are outdated
# All heavy rules have been moved to .cursor/enforcement/rules/
# Only lightweight LLM interface files remain in .cursor/rules/

# For reference only - shows where rules were located before migration:
# include:
#   - .cursor/enforcement/rules/00-master.mdc
#   - .cursor/enforcement/rules/01-enforcement.mdc
#   - .cursor/enforcement/rules/02-core.mdc
#   - ... (all rules now in .cursor/enforcement/rules/)

# See .cursorrules for current active rule loading
# See docs/architecture/TWO_BRAIN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for details
