## Recommended Context

### How Context Is Managed

This system uses a **hybrid context management approach**:

1. **Core Context (Automatic)**: Critical files like `schema.prisma`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` are automatically loaded via rule files in `.cursor/enforcement/rules/context/` (files with `context-` prefix). These are loaded at session start - no @ mention needed.

2. **Dynamic Context (Instruction-Based)**: Task-specific files are managed via `context_enforcement.mdc` with explicit @ mentions for the agent to load.

**See:** `.cursor/enforcement/rules/context_enforcement.mdc` for dynamic context instructions (enforcer-only, not loaded by LLM)

### Core Context (Automatic - Already Loaded)

These files are automatically loaded via rule files - no @ mention needed:

- `C:\Users\ashse\Documents\VeroField\Training\VeroField\.cursor\enforcement\rules\context\context-schema_prisma.mdc` (auto-loaded via rule file)
- `libs/common/prisma/schema.prisma` (will be auto-loaded)

### Dynamic Context (Load These - REQUIRED)

These files MUST be loaded with @ mentions:

- `@.cursor/enforcement/rules/python_bible.mdc` (PRIMARY - REQUIRED: Load with @ mention)
- `@.cursor/enforcement/rules/02-core.mdc` (PRIMARY - REQUIRED: Load with @ mention)

### Suggested Context (Optional - Not Loaded)

These files are suggested but NOT automatically loaded. Load manually if needed:

- `@.cursor/enforcement/rules/08-backend.mdc` (OPTIONAL - Load manually if needed)
- `@.cursor/patterns/**/*.md` (OPTIONAL - Load manually if needed)
- `@.cursor/rules/02-core.mdc` (OPTIONAL - Load manually if needed)
- `@.cursor/rules/07-observability.mdc` (OPTIONAL - Load manually if needed)

### Pre-loaded Context (Ready for Next Tasks)

No pre-loaded context files.

## Context Efficiency Metrics

- **Active Context Files:** 2
- **Pre-loaded Context Files:** 0
- **Context to Unload:** 1
- **Predictions Used:** None
- **Workflow Position:** 1 task(s) completed

## ⚠️ Two-Brain Model: Context Management

**NOTE:** In the Two-Brain Model, context management is handled by the enforcer (Brain A).
The LLM (Brain B) does not need to manage context loading/unloading.

### How Context Works

- **Core Context:** Automatically loaded by rule files - no action needed
- **Dynamic Context:** Managed by enforcer based on task requirements
- **LLM Responsibility:** Focus on implementation, not context management

## Troubleshooting

### How to Check for Session Restart Requirement

1. Check for `.cursor/enforcement/SESSION_RESTART_REQUIRED.mdc` file
2. If present, core context has changed - start new chat session
3. See file for detailed instructions

### How to See Core Context

- Context management is handled by enforcer (Brain A)
- LLM (Brain B) doesn't need to manage context

### How to See Dynamic Context (Enforcer Only)

- Read `.cursor/enforcement/rules/context_enforcement.mdc` file (enforcer-only, not loaded by LLM)
- Lists files that need @ mentions
- Agent must load these explicitly

---

## Context Management (Two-Brain Model)

**NOTE:** Context management is handled by the enforcer (Brain A).
The LLM (Brain B) focuses on implementation only.

### Context to Unload

- `@libs/common/prisma/schema.prisma` - **REMOVE @ mention**

## Failure to Comply

**HARD STOP:** If you do not:
- Read this file at task start/end
- Load required PRIMARY context files
- Unload obsolete context files
- Pre-load predicted context files

**Then:** Task execution is BLOCKED until context management is completed.
