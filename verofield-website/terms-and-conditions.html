                                These terms follow U.S. law. If we don't enforce a specific part right away, it doesn't mean we're giving up our rights — sometimes a conversation is better than jumping into enforcement.

                                Technology evolves, and our Terms may need to change too. If the updates are significant, we'll give you at least 30 days' notice so you can decide if the new terms still work for you.
