- `CustomersPage.tsx`: Updated to support multiple view modes
- `CompactLayout.css`: Enhanced with list view styles

### Key Features
- **State Management**: React hooks for selection, filtering, and tab state
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for mobile-first approach

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (1024px+)
- Full table with all columns visible
- 4-5 columns: Checkbox, Customer, Type, Contact, Location, AR Balance, Actions, Expand
- Tabbed navigation with full tab labels

### Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- Reduced padding and font sizes
- Contact and Location columns may be hidden
- Tabbed navigation with abbreviated labels

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Single column layout
- Collapsible sections for better mobile experience
- Touch-optimized button sizes (44px minimum)
- Horizontal scrolling for table content

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large customer lists (future enhancement)
- **Lazy Loading**: Tab content loads only when accessed
- **Memoization**: React.memo for expensive components
- **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive API calls

### Memory Management
- Efficient state updates using Set for selections
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Optimized re-renders with useMemo and useCallback

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle 1000+ customers efficiently
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, AR balance ranges, service history
3. **Bulk Actions**: Mass operations on selected customers
4. **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export of filtered data
5. **Customizable Columns**: User-defined column visibility
6. **Sorting**: Multi-column sorting with visual indicators
