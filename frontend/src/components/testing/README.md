## Technical Details

### Components

- **TestingDashboard**: Main dashboard component
- **TestExecutionService**: Service for running tests (currently mock implementation)
- **TestingDashboardPage**: Page wrapper component

### Test Execution

The dashboard currently uses a mock implementation that simulates test execution. This provides a realistic demonstration of the interface and functionality.

### Real Test Integration

To integrate with real tests, update the `TestExecutionService` to:

1. Execute actual test commands
2. Parse test output
3. Emit real-time events
4. Handle test failures gracefully

## Customization

### Adding New Test Categories

1. Update the `categories` array in `TestingDashboard.tsx`
2. Add corresponding test templates in `generateMockTests`
3. Update navigation items in the sidebar

### Styling

The dashboard uses Tailwind CSS classes. Customize the appearance by modifying the className properties in the components.

### Test Templates

Modify the `testTemplates` object in `generateMockTests` to add or remove test cases for each category.

## Future Enhancements

- Real test execution integration
- Test coverage reporting
- Historical test results
- Test performance metrics
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Test result notifications
- Custom test configurations
