## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Backend Requirements:**
```sql
-- User FAB Preferences Table
CREATE TABLE user_fab_preferences (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
  preferred_categories JSONB,
  pinned_actions JSONB,
  hidden_categories JSONB,
  custom_order JSONB,
  usage_analytics JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Frontend Architecture:**
```typescript
// Phase 2 Hook Structure
const { 
  customization, 
  updateCustomization, 
  analytics,
  suggestions 
} = useFABCustomization();

// Smart Category Filtering
const customizedCategories = getCustomizedCategories(
  fabCategories, 
  customization
);

// Context-Aware Actions
const contextActions = getContextualActions(
  currentPage, 
  selectedCustomer, 
  timeOfDay
);
```
