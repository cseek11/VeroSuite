# VeroCards v2 - Final Polish & Perfection

## ✅ **ALL REMAINING ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **1. Dashboard Title Removed - SPACE OPTIMIZED** ✅
**Problem**: "Customizable Dashboard" with green light taking up too much space
**Solution**: 
- Removed redundant dashboard title and green indicator
- Live collaboration indicator now serves as primary status
- Gained valuable toolbar space for more important controls
- Cleaner, more focused interface

### **2. Group Containment - ENFORCED** ✅
**Problem**: Grouped cards could leave their group area
**Solution**: 
- Added group boundary constraints to drag system
- Cards in groups cannot move outside group boundaries
- 5px margin within group bounds for proper containment
- Both single and multi-card drag respect group boundaries
- Visual feedback shows cards are contained within group borders

### **3. Group Lock Functionality - PERFECTED** ✅
**Problem**: Group lock not working (individual lock worked)
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced drag start check to respect group lock status
- Added visual indicators for cards in locked groups (red border)
- Prevented drag initiation for cards in locked groups
- Group lock now completely prevents movement of all contained cards

### **4. Reset Dashboard - COMPREHENSIVE** ✅
**Problem**: Reset didn't remove groups
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced reset function to clear all groups before resetting layout
- Added confirmation dialog: "Reset dashboard and remove all groups?"
- Complete cleanup of both cards and groups
- Fresh start functionality for clean workspace

### **5. Resize Performance - OPTIMIZED** ✅
**Problem**: Resize was sluggish and unresponsive
**Solution**: 
- Implemented immediate visual feedback (direct DOM style updates)
- Added 60fps debounced state updates (16ms throttling)
- Reduced maximum card sizes for better performance
- Simplified to only 3 resize handles (SE, E, S) for reliability
- Clear timeout cleanup to prevent lag accumulation
