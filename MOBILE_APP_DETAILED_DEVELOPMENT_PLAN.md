# VeroField Mobile App - Detailed Development Plan

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Platform:** React Native (Android & iOS)  
**Timeline:** 8 weeks to production

---

## 🔍 **EXISTING CODEBASE ANALYSIS**

### **What Already Exists (Frontend)**
- ✅ **TechnicianMobile.tsx** - Basic React component with placeholder functionality
- ✅ **Technician Management** - Complete technician CRUD operations
- ✅ **Work Order System** - Full work order management
- ✅ **Authentication** - JWT-based auth system
- ✅ **UI Components** - Tailwind CSS components and design system

### **What Already Exists (Backend)**
- ✅ **Jobs API** - Complete job management endpoints
- ✅ **Technician API** - Technician management endpoints
- ✅ **Authentication** - JWT authentication with tenant isolation
- ✅ **Database Schema** - Complete job, technician, and work order tables
- ⚠️ **Upload API** - Mock implementation (needs real S3 integration)
- ⚠️ **Routing API** - Basic routing (needs mobile optimization)

### **Critical Gaps Identified**
- ❌ **No React Native App** - Only web component exists
- ❌ **No Mobile API Endpoints** - Backend not optimized for mobile
- ❌ **No Photo Upload** - Mock implementation only
- ❌ **No Offline Support** - No offline data storage
- ❌ **No Push Notifications** - No mobile notification system
- ❌ **No GPS Integration** - No location services
