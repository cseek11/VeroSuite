This chapter is about where and how you run OPA. ________________________________________ 8.1 The PDP / PEP Split PDP (Policy Decision Point): OPA, evaluating Rego. PEP (Policy Enforcement Point): Your app, proxy, or platform component that: Collects input (HTTP request, Kubernetes object, Terraform plan, CI metadata). Sends it to PDP. Enforces the decision (allow/deny/mutate/log). OPA is only the PDP. The PEP is your responsibility. ________________________________________ 8.2 Deployment Topologies Sidecar / local daemon OPA runs alongside your service, often in the same Pod. Low latency, no network hop beyond localhost. Typical: Envoy external authz → OPA. Kubernetes admission controller → OPA sidecar in same namespace. Central PDP service OPA (or OPA-based service) runs as a central API. Multiple services call it over the network. Tradeoffs: Pros: Single place to manage policies; simpler distribution. Cons: Latency, scalability, SPOF (unless HA), multi-tenant complexity. Library / SDK Embed OPA: Go: github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego WASM: compile Rego to WASM and embed in any WASM host (Node, Rust, etc.). Useful for: Client-side enforcement (e.g., in a browser or mobile app). Edge scenarios. ________________________________________ 8.3 Integration Examples Kubernetes (Gatekeeper & friends) Admission review → OPA policy. Rego receives: input.request (raw AdmissionReview). data includes ConstraintTemplates, constraints, reference data. Typical structure: package kubernetes.admission

allow if { input.attributes.request.http.method == "GET" input.attributes.request.http.path == "/status" } CI/CD – GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. PR/diff metadata → JSON (opa-input.json). OPA evaluates data.compliance. CI interprets deny, warn, override arrays and posts PR comments / fails build. IaC scanning (Terraform, Kubernetes YAML) Terraform plan JSON or Kubernetes manifests as input. Policies check: Public buckets. Unencrypted volumes. Exposed security groups. ________________________________________ 8.4 Multi-layer Policy Architecture on OPA Layers usually look like: Global baseline – org-level security/compliance invariants. Domain policies – per product or platform (e.g., CRM, billing). Team/service policies – localized rules. Tenant overlays – per customer/tenant customizations. Implement via: Multiple bundles merged in OPA. Data-driven toggles (e.g., data.tenants[tenant_id].overrides). Rego evaluation order (e.g., base allow, then deny overlays). ________________________________________ 8.5 OPA as a Policy Mesh In large environments, you might have: Many OPAs running across clusters/namespaces. A central bundle server pushing policies. Decision logs shipped to SIEM / data lake. Rego itself doesn’t change; the architecture around it does. ________________________________________

OPA is particularly strong for data access policies because Rego is JSON-native. This chapter focuses on query-shaped inputs like GraphQL and REST. ________________________________________ 16.1 GraphQL AST Policies When a GraphQL query enters your gateway, you can: 1. Parse it into an AST. 2. Send AST + user context to OPA. 3. Enforce: o Field-level authorization. o Query depth/width limits. o Allowed operations. Example input (simplified): { "user": {"id": "alice", "roles": ["user"]}, "operation": "query", "query": { "name": "GetCustomer", "fields": [ {"path": ["customer", "email"]}, {"path": ["customer", "creditCardNumber"]} ] } } Policy: package gql.authz

semantic_categories: [distribution]
vector_summary: When you should use opa fmt 1
:::
When you should use opa fmt 1. Every time you write or modify Rego Just like go fmt or black for Python: • run opa fmt -w before committing • ensures consistent indentation, spacing, rule structure Use it when: • adding new policies • editing existing rules • refactoring code • reviewing a pull request ________________________________________ 2. Automatically in CI Use it in CI to prevent unformatted code from merging. Why? • Prevents style drift • Prevents person-to-person formatting debates • Keeps code reviews focused on logic, not style CI check: opa fmt --diff . Use it when you want CI to enforce a formatting contract. ________________________________________ 3. Before generating OPA bundles or deploying Formatting helps avoid: • unnecessary diff churn • unreadable bundle changes • merge conflicts caused by spacing differences Use it when preparing a release or bundle. ________________________________________ 4. When onboarding new developers New devs often write inconsistent Rego. opa fmt makes their code instantly match the organization’s style without a learning curve. Use it during: • onboarding • training • AI code generation reviews ________________________________________ 5. After using AI tools (Cursor, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) AI-generated Rego is usually: • valid • but not formatted to OPA conventions You should run opa fmt immediately after AI/model generation. This is especially true if: • you use Prompt Engineering to generate complex Rego • Cursor writes policy libraries • models generate example data ________________________________________ 6. When converting JSON/YAML schemas into Rego If you auto-generate code (e.g., from OPA schemas), format it afterward so it becomes readable. ________________________________________ 7. Anytime code readability matters Examples: • cross-team policy review • audits • security reviews • discussions with legal/compliance teams • contract policy negotiations Formatted policies reduce friction with stakeholders. ________________________________________ 🚫 When NOT to use it (rare cases) 1. When investigating a bug caused by whitespace or formatting Almost never happens in Rego, but if you're comparing raw text output or diffing a policy artifact to reproduce an issue, you might avoid opa fmt temporarily. 2. If formatting breaks a handcrafted test snapshot If you have an exact string match test involving policy source code, formatting will change the file. But this is extremely rare in real OPA projects.

:::
Multi-layer policy architecture is how you scale from one clever Rego file to hundreds of policy owners, bundles, and tenants without descending into chaos. At scale, you need: • Layers: global → domain → team → tenant. • Ownership metadata: who owns what, and how severe is it. • Override semantics: how do layers combine, and who wins on conflict. ________________________________________ 13.1 Layer Model: Global → Domain → Team → Tenant Think of policies as a stack of overlays: 1. Global Baseline (Organization Level) o Owned by: security/compliance. o Guarantees non-negotiable invariants:  “No public S3 buckets”  “All admin actions must be audited” o Usually has the highest precedence for denies (security wins). 2. Domain Policies (Product / Platform Level) o Example domains:  crm.*, billing.*, identity.*. o Define domain-specific invariants:  “An Opportunity must have an associated Account”  “A Subscription must have a plan and billing cycle” 3. Team / Service Policies o Local teams add guardrails and UX-level rules:  “This API must include X-Request-Id”  “This microservice cannot call that microservice directly” 4. Tenant Overlays (Customer-Specific) o Per-tenant exceptions and configuration:  “Tenant A enforces stricter password rules”  “Tenant B has a special approval workflow” OPA sees all of these as data + Rego modules merged into a single virtual data tree. ________________________________________ 13.2 Encoding Layers in Data and Packages One robust pattern: • Global policies: package global.* • Domains: package domain.<name>.* • Teams/services: package svc.<service_name>.* • Tenant overlays: data.tenants[tenant_id].* Example structure: policies/ global/ baseline.rego # package global.baseline crm/ authz.rego # package domain.crm.authz schema.rego # package domain.crm.schema svc/ accounts.rego # package svc.accounts.rules tenants/ 123/ overrides.json # data.tenants["123"] 456/ overrides.json ________________________________________ 13.3 Policy Ownership Metadata Every rule that matters should be self-describing. You can store metadata as: • A dedicated rule (__meta__) • Rego annotations (via rego.metadata.rule()) • Comments (less machine-friendly) Example: package crm.policies.account_lifecycle

OPA is not only a decision engine; it’s an evidence generator. Observability and audit are how you prove that decisions are: • Correct • Consistent • Explainable • Compliant with regulation ________________________________________ 14.1 Decision Logs Every OPA decision should be treatable as a replayable event: Minimum recommended fields: • decision_id (UUID) • timestamp • path (e.g., data.authz.allow) • input_hash or input (with PII scrubbing) • result (decision doc: allow/deny/effects) • bundle_revision • metrics (evaluation time, rule count) • correlation_id (to tie into tracing) Conceptual log: { "decision_id": "3f7b9b1a-0ee2-4e52-9f39-4edb8b6a3a01", "timestamp": "2025-12-05T10:02:45Z", "path": "data.authz.allow", "input_hash": "sha256:abcd...", "result": { "allow": false, "effects": [ { "effect": "deny", "rule_id": "ACCT_001", "layer": "domain", "msg": "Closed accounts cannot be reopened" } ] }, "bundle_revision": "git:1234abcd", "metrics": { "eval_time_ns": 45321, "num_rules_evaluated": 37 }, "correlation_id": "trace-xyz-123" } OPA supports decision logs via configuration; your host system should stream them to: • Kafka / Kinesis • ELK / Loki • Datadog / Prometheus / Grafana ________________________________________ 14.2 Metrics and SLOs To treat OPA like a production service, track at least: • Latency: o p50 / p95 / p99 evaluation time. • Throughput: o decisions per second. • Decision deltas: o How often outcomes change after a new bundle. • Error rate: o Number of evaluation failures (e.g., built-in errors in strict mode). Define SLOs like: • 99.9% of policy decisions complete in < 10 ms. • < 0.1% of decisions result in evaluation error. • Decision delta after bundle rollout < 1% for stable inputs (in shadow mode). ________________________________________ 14.3 Correlation IDs and Tracing Policy evaluations rarely stand alone; they’re part of a larger request trace: • HTTP header: o X-Request-Id o traceparent (W3C Trace Context) • PEP should pass correlation ID in: o input.trace_id o or embed as part of input.request.headers. Then decision logs include correlation_id, which lets you: • Trace a single user’s journey across services. • Root-cause analyze unauthorized/denied requests quickly. Example pattern: package authz

To achieve this: • Store: o Bundle artifacts (bundle.tar.gz) o Manifest metadata (revision, version) o Decision logs + input fixtures (or deterministic reconstruction) • Avoid: o Non-deterministic calls in Rego (e.g., random, uncontrolled http.send) When you must use time.now_ns or external data: • Either: o Snapshot it in the input used to evaluate. o Or store enough context to reconstruct. ________________________________________

:::
LLMs are good at generating Rego, OPA is good at executing and verifying Rego. Together they form: “AI drafts policy, OPA and tests keep it safe.” ________________________________________ 17.1 The Agentic Workflow Canonical pipeline: 1. Requirements in natural language: o “API keys must not be visible in logs” o “Admin role modifications require approval” 2. LLM drafts: o Rego module. o Test suite (_test.rego). o Metadata (owner, rule_id). 3. Static checks: o opa fmt o Regal lint o opa check --strict 4. Dynamic checks: o opa test (unit + integration tests). o Fuzz/Golden tests for critical policies. 5. Human review: o Security / Policy engineers review diff, semantics. 6. Bundle build & rollout: o Standard policy SDLC. OPA becomes the execution and verification back-end for LLM-authored policy. ________________________________________ 17.2 Guardrails for LLM-Generated Rego When you let an LLM write Rego, you must: • Enforce style & safety: o Modern syntax only (import rego.v1 or future.keywords). o No http.send in production rules (unless explicitly allowed). o No secrets in code. o Type guards for all input.* references. • Require tests: o At least one positive and one negative case. o Use with overrides instead of real network/time. You can encode this as Rego that reviews Rego: • Use rego.metadata.chain() and AST analysis to enforce rules. • Or use external tools (Regal) plus your own AST/grep rules. ________________________________________ 17.3 “Policy Copilot” Pattern A typical agentic stack: 1. Authoring agent: o Generates initial Rego module + tests from description and examples. 2. Critic agent: o Reads module, runs static analysis (Regal messages, opa check). o Suggests improvements and simplifications. 3. Tester agent: o Proposes additional tests (edge cases, negative paths). o Extends _test.rego. 4. Reviewer agent: o Summarizes behavior in human language. o Flags risky constructs, ambiguous cases. 5. Bundle builder: o Once human approves, compiles into bundle artifact. OPA is the deterministic core all these agents orbit around. ________________________________________ 17.4 LLM Self-Checking with Rego LLMs can call OPA during prompt execution: • Use examples like: o “Write a policy such that opa eval returns allow=true for these inputs and false for others.” • LLM loops: 1. Generate candidate Rego. 2. Invoke opa test programmatically. 3. If tests fail, update policy and try again (up to N iterations). 4. Present final Rego + test report. This turns Rego into a ground truth oracle inside an agentic system. ________________________________________

Alphabetical list of core terms. ________________________________________ ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) Access model where decisions are based on attributes of subject, resource, action, and environment, not just roles. Allow / Deny (Effects) Canonical authorization decision outcomes. Frequently modeled via Rego rules like allow and deny or decision documents with effects. AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Tree representation of parsed input (e.g., GraphQL query), often passed to OPA as input for fine-grained policies. Baseline Policy (Global Baseline) Organization-wide invariant policy layer that lower layers cannot override or weaken (e.g., “No public S3 buckets”). Bundle A versioned tarball containing Rego policies, data, and a .manifest file. Used by OPA to load and update policies in production. Complete Rule A Rego rule that defines a single final value (e.g., max_conns := 10 or allow := true). Multiple definitions that produce different values for the same input cause conflicts. ConstraintTemplate (Gatekeeper) Kubernetes CRD that defines reusable OPA policies for Gatekeeper. Users instantiate constraints based on templates. Correlation ID Identifier used to tie together logs and traces across systems, included in OPA decision logs for observability. Data (in OPA) Persistent, relatively static information (loaded from bundles or in-memory), accessed as data.*. May mirror configuration, schemas, user roles, etc. Decision Document The JSON result of an OPA query (e.g., data.authz.allow or a more complex document with allow, deny, effects, risk_score). Decision Log Structured record of each OPA evaluation: includes path, input (or hash), result, metrics, and bundle revision, used for audit and observability. Datalog A subset of Prolog used for declarative logic programming, without complex function symbols. Rego is inspired by Datalog and extends it with JSON-like structures. Deny Rule A partial rule (often deny[msg] or deny contains msg) that accumulates violation messages, typically used in compliance and validation policies. Effect The semantic outcome of a policy evaluation (e.g., "allow", "deny", "warn", "override"), often encoded in decision documents. Fixpoint A stable interpretation of a logic program where applying the immediate consequence operator (deriving new facts) produces no new facts. Rego’s semantics can be described via least fixpoints. Future Keywords The future.keywords import (Rego v0.x) that enables newer language constructs like if, in, contains, every. In OPA 1.0+ this is replaced by import rego.v1. Global Baseline See Baseline Policy: global layer of policies applied to all services/tenants, usually with highest precedence for security. GraphQL Policy Policy that operates on GraphQL queries represented as AST; can enforce field-level auth, query depth, or cost. HTTP Sidecar Deployment pattern where OPA runs as a sidecar container next to a service, receiving authorization queries over localhost. Input (in OPA) Per-request JSON document provided by the caller to OPA, containing details like user, action, resource, HTTP request, etc. Accessed as input.*. LLM (Large Language Model) Neural network model (like ChatGPT) used to generate or refactor Rego; OPA then validates and executes resulting policies. NAF (Negation-as-Failure) Logic programming semantics where not p(X) means “p(X) cannot be proven.” Used in Rego for negation. OPA (Open Policy Agent) General-purpose policy decision engine that evaluates Rego policies against JSON inputs and data. PDP (Policy Decision Point) Component that computes policy decisions (e.g., OPA). PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) Component that enforces decisions (e.g., API gateway, Kubernetes admission controller). Partial Evaluation (PE) Technique where OPA specializes policies with respect to known input and data, producing an optimized, often smaller program or WASM artifact. Partial Rule A Rego rule that defines members of a virtual set or object incrementally (e.g., deny[msg] or roles[user] := role). Rego OPA’s declarative policy language, inspired by Datalog and designed for reasoning over JSON-like documents. Regal A dedicated linter for Rego, enforcing style and correctness rules beyond opa fmt. Rule Conflict Runtime error when multiple complete rules or function rules with the same name and arguments produce different values. Schema (JSON Schema) Formal type definition for JSON documents. OPA can use schemas to perform type checking on input or data. Sidecar Deployment pattern where OPA runs alongside an application in the same Pod/host, reducing network latency for policy queries. Stateful Policy Policy whose decision depends on past events or accumulated state. Implemented in OPA by passing state snapshots as data or input, not by mutability in Rego. Stratification Property of a logic program whereby cycles through negation are avoided, enabling well-defined semantics for negation-as-failure. Temporal Policy Policy that involves time (e.g., deadlines, windows, schedules), typically implemented with time.* built-ins and time-stamped state. Tenant Overlay Per-tenant policy or configuration that tightens (but does not weaken) global/domain rules, often stored under data.tenants[tenant_id]. Virtual Document A Rego rule or package that behaves like a JSON document when queried (e.g., data.authz.allow), although it is computed on demand rather than stored. WASM (WebAssembly) Portable binary format that can run Rego policies compiled from OPA in multiple environments (browsers, proxies, services). With (Keyword) Rego keyword that allows overriding input, data, or built-ins for the scope of an expression; heavily used in testing and mocking. Zero-Trust Architecture Security model where no implicit trust is granted to assets or user accounts based solely on network location; OPA policies often implement zero-trust authorization logic.

:::
Answer: The warn reference comes from the data tree, not from the import. During opa test, OPA loads all policies under services/opa/policies/ into the data namespace. When the test references warn, OPA resolves it by searching all packages for a rule named warn, which finds data.compliance.tech_debt.warn. Because the test never uses tech_debt.warn, the import data.compliance.tech_debt is unused and can be removed.

Harness: performs all file I/O and passes JSON into Rego as input or data. ________________________________________ 7.4 Debugging with print and opa eval print is your printf. Signature: print(x1, x2, ...) Always returns true, so you can drop it directly inside rule bodies. debug_threshold if { t := input.threshold print("Threshold is:", t) t > 10 } Where output appears opa eval → printed to stderr / logs. Embedded OPA → appears in OPA logs; your host system should capture these. Key points print doesn’t alter semantics (just like adding true). Good for: Inspecting variable bindings. Confirming which rule body is being hit. Bad for: Production policies with PII. Flooding logs; use sparingly or behind a debug flag. ________________________________________ 7.5 opa eval Explain & Profile Modes opa eval is both a REPL and microscope. Explain modes opa eval --explain=notes -d policy.rego -i input.json 'data.authz.allow' opa eval --explain=full ... notes = high-level reasoning (rule success/failure). full = full derivation tree; great for debugging, painful for huge queries. Profile mode opa eval --profile -d . -i input.json 'data.compliance' You get: Per-rule evaluation counts and cumulative time. A ranking of “hot” rules (the ones to optimize or refactor). Typical workflow Problem: “Policy is slow for large PRs / big cluster.” Run: opa eval --profile ... Identify rules with: Many evaluations (thousands or millions). High total time. Refactor: Use sets/objects instead of scanning arrays. Add guard conditions (cheap predicates before expensive ones). Use partial evaluation (§11). ________________________________________ 7.6 Common Errors and How to Diagnose Them rego_unsafe_var_error – unsafe variables # ❌ Unsafe: user appears only under negation deny if { not blacklisted[user] } Fix: Bind user outside negation. deny if { user := input.user not blacklisted[user] } rego_type_error – type mismatch Example: using to_number on an object, or sum over [1, "two"]. Fix: Guard with is_* built-ins (is_number(x), is_array(x)). Normalize incoming data. Rule conflict errors Multiple complete rules with same name produce different values for same input. f(1) := 2 f(1) := 3 # conflict For sets/partial objects this is okay (results are merged); for complete rules & functions it’s an error. Infinite or pathological recursion Patterns that refer back to themselves without a base case. OPA has guardrails, but logic errors can still create huge evaluation trees. Mitigate with: Explicit depth counters. Clear base rules. ________________________________________ 7.7 String Literal Handling in Tests: JSON vs Rego String Semantics

chapter: 
q: What is When you should use opa fmt 1 in the context of Rego/OPA?
a: When you should use opa fmt 1. Every time you write or modify Rego Just like go fmt or black for Python: • run opa fmt -w before committing • ensures consistent indentation, spacing, rule structure Use it when: • adding new policies • editing existing rules • refactoring code • reviewing a pull request ________________________________________ 2. Automatically in CI Use it in CI to prevent unformatted code from merging. Why? • Prevents style drift • Prevents person-to-person formatting debates • Keeps code reviews focused on logic, not style CI check: opa fmt --diff . Use it when you want CI to enforce a formatting contract. ________________________________________ 3. Before generating OPA bundles or deploying Formatting helps avoid: • unnecessary diff churn • unreadable bundle changes • merge conflicts caused by spacing differences Use it when preparing a release or bundle. ________________________________________ 4. When onboarding new developers New devs often write inconsistent Rego. opa fmt makes their code instantly match the organization’s style without a learning curve. Use it during: • onboarding • training • AI code generation reviews ________________________________________ 5. After using AI tools (Cursor, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) AI-generated Rego is usually: • valid • but not formatted to OPA conventions You should run opa fmt immediately after AI/model generation. This is especially true if: • you use Prompt Engineering to generate complex Rego • Cursor writes policy libraries • models generate example data ________________________________________ 6. When converting JSON/YAML schemas into Rego If you auto-generate code (e.g., from OPA schemas), format it afterward so it becomes readable. ________________________________________ 7. Anytime code readability matters Examples: • cross-team policy review • audits • security reviews • discussions with legal/compliance teams • contract policy negotiations Formatted policies reduce friction with stakeholders. ________________________________________ 🚫 When NOT to use it (rare cases) 1. When investigating a bug caused by whitespace or formatting Almost never happens in Rego, but if you're comparing raw text output or diffing a policy artifact to reproduce an issue, you might avoid opa fmt temporarily. 2. If formatting breaks a handcrafted test snapshot If you have an exact string match test involving policy source code, formatting will change the file. But this is extremely rare in real OPA projects.

Check that test suite fails appropriately. Failing to detect "killed" mutants = missing tests.

q: What is This chapter is about where and how you run OPA in the context of Rego/OPA?
a: This chapter is about where and how you run OPA. ________________________________________ 8.1 The PDP / PEP Split PDP (Policy Decision Point): OPA, evaluating Rego. PEP (Policy Enforcement Point): Your app, proxy, or platform component that: Collects input (HTTP request, Kubernetes object, Terraform plan, CI metadata). Sends it to PDP. Enforces the decision (allow/deny/mutate/log). OPA is only the PDP. The PEP is your responsibility. ________________________________________ 8.2 Deployment Topologies Sidecar / local daemon OPA runs alongside your service, often in the same Pod. Low latency, no network hop beyond localhost. Typical: Envoy external authz → OPA. Kubernetes admission controller → OPA sidecar in same namespace. Central PDP service OPA (or OPA-based service) runs as a central API. Multiple services call it over the network. Tradeoffs: Pros: Single place to manage policies; simpler distribution. Cons: Latency, scalability, SPOF (unless HA), multi-tenant complexity. Library / SDK Embed OPA: Go: github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego WASM: compile Rego to WASM and embed in any WASM host (Node, Rust, etc.). Useful for: Client-side enforcement (e.g., in a browser or mobile app). Edge scenarios. ________________________________________ 8.3 Integration Examples Kubernetes (Gatekeeper & friends) Admission review → OPA policy. Rego receives: input.request (raw AdmissionReview). data includes ConstraintTemplates, constraints, reference data. Typical structure: package kubernetes.admission

a: allow if { input.attributes.request.http.method == "GET" input.attributes.request.http.path == "/status" } CI/CD – GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. PR/diff metadata → JSON (opa-input.json). OPA evaluates data.compliance. CI interprets deny, warn, override arrays and posts PR comments / fails build. IaC scanning (Terraform, Kubernetes YAML) Terraform plan JSON or Kubernetes manifests as input. Policies check: Public buckets. Unencrypted volumes. Exposed security groups. ________________________________________ 8.4 Multi-layer Policy Architecture on OPA Layers usually look like: Global baseline – org-level security/compliance invariants. Domain policies – per product or platform (e.g., CRM, billing). Team/service policies – localized rules. Tenant overlays – per customer/tenant customizations. Implement via: Multiple bundles merged in OPA. Data-driven toggles (e.g., data.tenants[tenant_id].overrides). Rego evaluation order (e.g., base allow, then deny overlays). ________________________________________ 8.5 OPA as a Policy Mesh In large environments, you might have: Many OPAs running across clusters/namespaces. A central bundle server pushing policies. Decision logs shipped to SIEM / data lake. Rego itself doesn’t change; the architecture around it does. ________________________________________

a: Even perfect policies are useless if they’re unreadable or unmaintainable. This chapter merges style guides, linting, and CI patterns into an enforceable system. ________________________________________ 10.1 Style Principles (Based on Styra + Enterprise Practice) Readability first Prefer clear, small rules over clever one-liners. Use opa fmt always Standardizes indentation, spacing, and layout. Enforce via CI. Use modern syntax (Rego v1) if, contains, every, some ... in .... Import rego.v1 or future.keywords when needed. Naming conventions Packages: domain.service.component crm.authz.http, infra.k8s.admission. Rules & functions: snake_case. Helper rules: prefix with _ (convention). package crm.authz.http

a: Multi-layer policy architecture is how you scale from one clever Rego file to hundreds of policy owners, bundles, and tenants without descending into chaos. At scale, you need: • Layers: global → domain → team → tenant. • Ownership metadata: who owns what, and how severe is it. • Override semantics: how do layers combine, and who wins on conflict. ________________________________________ 13.1 Layer Model: Global → Domain → Team → Tenant Think of policies as a stack of overlays: 1. Global Baseline (Organization Level) o Owned by: security/compliance. o Guarantees non-negotiable invariants:  “No public S3 buckets”  “All admin actions must be audited” o Usually has the highest precedence for denies (security wins). 2. Domain Policies (Product / Platform Level) o Example domains:  crm.*, billing.*, identity.*. o Define domain-specific invariants:  “An Opportunity must have an associated Account”  “A Subscription must have a plan and billing cycle” 3. Team / Service Policies o Local teams add guardrails and UX-level rules:  “This API must include X-Request-Id”  “This microservice cannot call that microservice directly” 4. Tenant Overlays (Customer-Specific) o Per-tenant exceptions and configuration:  “Tenant A enforces stricter password rules”  “Tenant B has a special approval workflow” OPA sees all of these as data + Rego modules merged into a single virtual data tree. ________________________________________ 13.2 Encoding Layers in Data and Packages One robust pattern: • Global policies: package global.* • Domains: package domain.<name>.* • Teams/services: package svc.<service_name>.* • Tenant overlays: data.tenants[tenant_id].* Example structure: policies/ global/ baseline.rego # package global.baseline crm/ authz.rego # package domain.crm.authz schema.rego # package domain.crm.schema svc/ accounts.rego # package svc.accounts.rules tenants/ 123/ overrides.json # data.tenants["123"] 456/ overrides.json ________________________________________ 13.3 Policy Ownership Metadata Every rule that matters should be self-describing. You can store metadata as: • A dedicated rule (__meta__) • Rego annotations (via rego.metadata.rule()) • Comments (less machine-friendly) Example: package crm.policies.account_lifecycle

chapter: 
q: What is OPA is not only a decision engine; it’s an evidence generator in the context of Rego/OPA?
a: OPA is not only a decision engine; it’s an evidence generator. Observability and audit are how you prove that decisions are: • Correct • Consistent • Explainable • Compliant with regulation ________________________________________ 14.1 Decision Logs Every OPA decision should be treatable as a replayable event: Minimum recommended fields: • decision_id (UUID) • timestamp • path (e.g., data.authz.allow) • input_hash or input (with PII scrubbing) • result (decision doc: allow/deny/effects) • bundle_revision • metrics (evaluation time, rule count) • correlation_id (to tie into tracing) Conceptual log: { "decision_id": "3f7b9b1a-0ee2-4e52-9f39-4edb8b6a3a01", "timestamp": "2025-12-05T10:02:45Z", "path": "data.authz.allow", "input_hash": "sha256:abcd...", "result": { "allow": false, "effects": [ { "effect": "deny", "rule_id": "ACCT_001", "layer": "domain", "msg": "Closed accounts cannot be reopened" } ] }, "bundle_revision": "git:1234abcd", "metrics": { "eval_time_ns": 45321, "num_rules_evaluated": 37 }, "correlation_id": "trace-xyz-123" } OPA supports decision logs via configuration; your host system should stream them to: • Kafka / Kinesis • ELK / Loki • Datadog / Prometheus / Grafana ________________________________________ 14.2 Metrics and SLOs To treat OPA like a production service, track at least: • Latency: o p50 / p95 / p99 evaluation time. • Throughput: o decisions per second. • Decision deltas: o How often outcomes change after a new bundle. • Error rate: o Number of evaluation failures (e.g., built-in errors in strict mode). Define SLOs like: • 99.9% of policy decisions complete in < 10 ms. • < 0.1% of decisions result in evaluation error. • Decision delta after bundle rollout < 1% for stable inputs (in shadow mode). ________________________________________ 14.3 Correlation IDs and Tracing Policy evaluations rarely stand alone; they’re part of a larger request trace: • HTTP header: o X-Request-Id o traceparent (W3C Trace Context) • PEP should pass correlation ID in: o input.trace_id o or embed as part of input.request.headers. Then decision logs include correlation_id, which lets you: • Trace a single user’s journey across services. • Root-cause analyze unauthorized/denied requests quickly. Example pattern: package authz

q: What is # decision doc decision  in the context of Rego/OPA?
a: # decision doc decision := { "allow": allow, "trace_id": trace_id, } ________________________________________ 14.4 PII and Redaction in Logs Golden rule: logs must not become a data breach. • Do not log entire input if it contains PII. • Instead: o Log hashed fields (hash(email)) o Log ids / foreign keys o Redact sensitive values (e.g., use "redacted") Pattern: safe_input := { "user_id": input.user.id, "tenant_id": input.tenant_id, "resource_id": input.resource.id, "action": input.action, } Your decision logger uses safe_input rather than raw input. ________________________________________ 14.5 Reproducibility & Auditability A compliant audit story usually needs: • Given: o bundle_revision o policy_version o input (or hash + associated fixture) • You can re-evaluate the decision and get the same result. To achieve this: • Store: o Bundle artifacts (bundle.tar.gz) o Manifest metadata (revision, version) o Decision logs + input fixtures (or deterministic reconstruction) • Avoid: o Non-deterministic calls in Rego (e.g., random, uncontrolled http.send) When you must use time.now_ns or external data: • Either: o Snapshot it in the input used to evaluate. o Or store enough context to reconstruct. ________________________________________

q: What is OPA itself is stateless in the context of Rego/OPA?
a: OPA itself is stateless: each query sees input and data as immutable snapshots. Yet many policies are stateful or temporal: • Rate limits (N requests per unit time) • “No more than 5 failed logins in 10 minutes” • “This migration must be rolled out only after all canaries pass” The trick: Move state and time into data + input, not inside Rego. ________________________________________ Stateful & Temporal Extensions

Events flow into Kafka / Kinesis. 2. A stream processor: o Maintains aggregates:  counts, sums, last-seen times, sliding windows. o Writes materialized state to:  Redis, DB, or data-bundles for OPA. 3. OPA uses that state to decide: o Allow or deny new events. o Trigger downstream actions/alerts. OPA remains pure — no long-lived state, no hidden mutable variables. ________________________________________ 15.4 Time-Scoped Exceptions Sometimes you want: • “Allow this temporary override until 2025-12-05.” Pattern: package overrides

q: What is LLMs are good at generating Rego, OPA is good at executing and verifying Rego in the context of Rego/OPA?
a: LLMs are good at generating Rego, OPA is good at executing and verifying Rego. Together they form: “AI drafts policy, OPA and tests keep it safe.” ________________________________________ 17.1 The Agentic Workflow Canonical pipeline: 1. Requirements in natural language: o “API keys must not be visible in logs” o “Admin role modifications require approval” 2. LLM drafts: o Rego module. o Test suite (_test.rego). o Metadata (owner, rule_id). 3. Static checks: o opa fmt o Regal lint o opa check --strict 4. Dynamic checks: o opa test (unit + integration tests). o Fuzz/Golden tests for critical policies. 5. Human review: o Security / Policy engineers review diff, semantics. 6. Bundle build & rollout: o Standard policy SDLC. OPA becomes the execution and verification back-end for LLM-authored policy. ________________________________________ 17.2 Guardrails for LLM-Generated Rego When you let an LLM write Rego, you must: • Enforce style & safety: o Modern syntax only (import rego.v1 or future.keywords). o No http.send in production rules (unless explicitly allowed). o No secrets in code. o Type guards for all input.* references. • Require tests: o At least one positive and one negative case. o Use with overrides instead of real network/time. You can encode this as Rego that reviews Rego: • Use rego.metadata.chain() and AST analysis to enforce rules. • Or use external tools (Regal) plus your own AST/grep rules. ________________________________________ 17.3 “Policy Copilot” Pattern A typical agentic stack: 1. Authoring agent: o Generates initial Rego module + tests from description and examples. 2. Critic agent: o Reads module, runs static analysis (Regal messages, opa check). o Suggests improvements and simplifications. 3. Tester agent: o Proposes additional tests (edge cases, negative paths). o Extends _test.rego. 4. Reviewer agent: o Summarizes behavior in human language. o Flags risky constructs, ambiguous cases. 5. Bundle builder: o Once human approves, compiles into bundle artifact. OPA is the deterministic core all these agents orbit around. ________________________________________ 17.4 LLM Self-Checking with Rego LLMs can call OPA during prompt execution: • Use examples like: o “Write a policy such that opa eval returns allow=true for these inputs and false for others.” • LLM loops: 1. Generate candidate Rego. 2. Invoke opa test programmatically. 3. If tests fail, update policy and try again (up to N iterations). 4. Present final Rego + test report. This turns Rego into a ground truth oracle inside an agentic system. ________________________________________

q: What is **Important in the context of Rego/OPA?
a: **Important:** `set()` is a type conversion function (e.g., `set([1,2,3])` → `{1,2,3}`) and requires an argument. To create an empty set, use `{}` directly. Using `set()` without arguments will cause a runtime error. ________________________________________ 18.4 Iteration Implicit: arr[_] # all values obj[k] # binds k to each key set[v] # binds v to each member Explicit with some ... in: some x in arr # values some i, x in arr # index, value some k, v in obj # key, value some v in set # members ________________________________________ 18.5 Quantifiers • Existential: some x in xs { ... } • Universal: o Using every: o all_valid if { o every x in xs { o x.valid == true o } o } o Or via negation: o all_valid if not any_invalid o any_invalid if { o some x in xs o not x.valid o } ________________________________________ 18.6 Negation not cond = “cannot prove cond.” Safety: variables in cond must be bound beforehand. deny if { user := input.user not blacklisted[user] } ________________________________________ 18.7 Built-in Highlights • Aggregates: count, sum, max, min • Strings: concat, contains, startswith, endswith, split, replace • Regex: regex.match, regex.split • JSON: json.marshal, json.unmarshal • Time: time.now_ns, time.parse_rfc3339_ns, time.clock • Crypto: crypto.sha256, io.jwt.* ________________________________________ 18.8 Testing • Tests: package ending in _test, rules starting with test_. • Use with to override input, data, or built-ins. test_admin_can_read if { authz.allow with input as {"user": "alice", "role": "admin"} } Run: opa test . ________________________________________ 18.9 Best Practices (Ultra Condensed) • Always opa fmt and lint. • Use modern syntax (import rego.v1 or future.keywords). • Prefer sets/objects for membership tests. • Avoid inline comprehensions in complex allow/deny. • Use helper rules with clear names. • Always have tests for deny/allow semantics. ________________________________________

q: What is Alphabetical list of core terms in the context of Rego/OPA?
a: Alphabetical list of core terms. ________________________________________ ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) Access model where decisions are based on attributes of subject, resource, action, and environment, not just roles. Allow / Deny (Effects) Canonical authorization decision outcomes. Frequently modeled via Rego rules like allow and deny or decision documents with effects. AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Tree representation of parsed input (e.g., GraphQL query), often passed to OPA as input for fine-grained policies. Baseline Policy (Global Baseline) Organization-wide invariant policy layer that lower layers cannot override or weaken (e.g., “No public S3 buckets”). Bundle A versioned tarball containing Rego policies, data, and a .manifest file. Used by OPA to load and update policies in production. Complete Rule A Rego rule that defines a single final value (e.g., max_conns := 10 or allow := true). Multiple definitions that produce different values for the same input cause conflicts. ConstraintTemplate (Gatekeeper) Kubernetes CRD that defines reusable OPA policies for Gatekeeper. Users instantiate constraints based on templates. Correlation ID Identifier used to tie together logs and traces across systems, included in OPA decision logs for observability. Data (in OPA) Persistent, relatively static information (loaded from bundles or in-memory), accessed as data.*. May mirror configuration, schemas, user roles, etc. Decision Document The JSON result of an OPA query (e.g., data.authz.allow or a more complex document with allow, deny, effects, risk_score). Decision Log Structured record of each OPA evaluation: includes path, input (or hash), result, metrics, and bundle revision, used for audit and observability. Datalog A subset of Prolog used for declarative logic programming, without complex function symbols. Rego is inspired by Datalog and extends it with JSON-like structures. Deny Rule A partial rule (often deny[msg] or deny contains msg) that accumulates violation messages, typically used in compliance and validation policies. Effect The semantic outcome of a policy evaluation (e.g., "allow", "deny", "warn", "override"), often encoded in decision documents. Fixpoint A stable interpretation of a logic program where applying the immediate consequence operator (deriving new facts) produces no new facts. Rego’s semantics can be described via least fixpoints. Future Keywords The future.keywords import (Rego v0.x) that enables newer language constructs like if, in, contains, every. In OPA 1.0+ this is replaced by import rego.v1. Global Baseline See Baseline Policy: global layer of policies applied to all services/tenants, usually with highest precedence for security. GraphQL Policy Policy that operates on GraphQL queries represented as AST; can enforce field-level auth, query depth, or cost. HTTP Sidecar Deployment pattern where OPA runs as a sidecar container next to a service, receiving authorization queries over localhost. Input (in OPA) Per-request JSON document provided by the caller to OPA, containing details like user, action, resource, HTTP request, etc. Accessed as input.*. LLM (Large Language Model) Neural network model (like ChatGPT) used to generate or refactor Rego; OPA then validates and executes resulting policies. NAF (Negation-as-Failure) Logic programming semantics where not p(X) means “p(X) cannot be proven.” Used in Rego for negation. OPA (Open Policy Agent) General-purpose policy decision engine that evaluates Rego policies against JSON inputs and data. PDP (Policy Decision Point) Component that computes policy decisions (e.g., OPA). PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) Component that enforces decisions (e.g., API gateway, Kubernetes admission controller). Partial Evaluation (PE) Technique where OPA specializes policies with respect to known input and data, producing an optimized, often smaller program or WASM artifact. Partial Rule A Rego rule that defines members of a virtual set or object incrementally (e.g., deny[msg] or roles[user] := role). Rego OPA’s declarative policy language, inspired by Datalog and designed for reasoning over JSON-like documents. Regal A dedicated linter for Rego, enforcing style and correctness rules beyond opa fmt. Rule Conflict Runtime error when multiple complete rules or function rules with the same name and arguments produce different values. Schema (JSON Schema) Formal type definition for JSON documents. OPA can use schemas to perform type checking on input or data. Sidecar Deployment pattern where OPA runs alongside an application in the same Pod/host, reducing network latency for policy queries. Stateful Policy Policy whose decision depends on past events or accumulated state. Implemented in OPA by passing state snapshots as data or input, not by mutability in Rego. Stratification Property of a logic program whereby cycles through negation are avoided, enabling well-defined semantics for negation-as-failure. Temporal Policy Policy that involves time (e.g., deadlines, windows, schedules), typically implemented with time.* built-ins and time-stamped state. Tenant Overlay Per-tenant policy or configuration that tightens (but does not weaken) global/domain rules, often stored under data.tenants[tenant_id]. Virtual Document A Rego rule or package that behaves like a JSON document when queried (e.g., data.authz.allow), although it is computed on demand rather than stored. WASM (WebAssembly) Portable binary format that can run Rego policies compiled from OPA in multiple environments (browsers, proxies, services). With (Keyword) Rego keyword that allows overriding input, data, or built-ins for the scope of an expression; heavily used in testing and mocking. Zero-Trust Architecture Security model where no implicit trust is granted to assets or user accounts based solely on network location; OPA policies often implement zero-trust authorization logic.

q: What is Answer in the context of Rego/OPA?
a: Answer: The warn reference comes from the data tree, not from the import. During opa test, OPA loads all policies under services/opa/policies/ into the data namespace. When the test references warn, OPA resolves it by searching all packages for a rule named warn, which finds data.compliance.tech_debt.warn. Because the test never uses tech_debt.warn, the import data.compliance.tech_debt is unused and can be removed.
