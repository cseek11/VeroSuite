# Two-Brain Model: Final Cleanup Complete

**Date:** 2025-12-02  
**Status:** ✅ Cleanup Complete

---

## Files Removed

### ✅ Deleted

1. **`.cursor/rules/agent-instructions.mdc`**
   - **Reason:** Legacy file with old Single-Brain Model references
   - **Conflicts:** References all heavy rules, contains 5-step pipeline instructions
   - **Status:** Not loaded by `.cursorrules` (not referenced)
   - **Action:** Deleted ✅

2. **`.cursor/rules/context/` folder**
   - **Reason:** Part of old context management system
   - **Status:** User deleted ✅

---

## Current State

### `.cursor/rules/` (Brain B - LLM Interface Only)

**Files Remaining:**
- ✅ `00-llm-interface.mdc` - Core LLM protocol
- ✅ `01-llm-security-lite.mdc` - Security reminders
- ✅ `02-llm-fix-mode.mdc` - Fix mode behavior
- ✅ `SESSION_RESTART_REQUIRED.mdc` - Dynamic (generated by enforcer)

**Total:** 3-4 files (as designed for Two-Brain Model)

### `.cursor/enforcement/rules/` (Brain A - Enforcer Only)

**Files:**
- ✅ All 18 heavy rule files
- ✅ `context_enforcement.mdc` (generated by enforcer)

---

## Conflicts Resolved

### ✅ Fixed

1. **Auto-Enforcer Code**
   - Updated `context_enforcement.mdc` generation path
   - Updated documentation references

2. **Context State File**
   - Updated to use new rule paths (user reverted - may need to check)

3. **Legacy Files**
   - Removed `agent-instructions.mdc`
   - Removed `context/` folder

### ⚠️ Note

**`.cursor/context_manager/context_state.json`**
- User reverted paths back to `.cursor/rules/`
- This may be intentional (context manager may still reference old paths)
- Will auto-update when enforcer runs

## Verification

### LLM (Brain B) Context

**Should Load:**
- `00-llm-interface.mdc`
- `01-llm-security-lite.mdc`
- `02-llm-fix-mode.mdc`
- `memory-bank/summary.md`

**Total:** 3-4 files (~8-15k tokens)

### Enforcer (Brain A) Context

**Loads:**
- All 18 heavy rules from `.cursor/enforcement/rules/`
- Full Memory Bank files
- Full codebase analysis

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Cleanup complete
2. ⏳ Test LLM context (should be 3-4 files only)
3. ⏳ Verify enforcer still works
4. ⏳ Monitor for any remaining conflicts

**Status:** Cleanup Complete ✅  
**Two-Brain Model:** Ready for Testing
