   - Should show only 3-4 files loaded
   - Should NOT show agent-instructions.mdc

2. **File Structure:**
   - `.cursor/rules/` has only LLM interface files
   - `.cursor/enforcement/rules/` has all heavy rules
   - No conflicts remaining

3. **Enforcer:**
   - Run: `python .cursor/scripts/auto-enforcer.py`
   - Should generate reports correctly
   - Should generate context files in new location
