# VC3-13: Documentation and migration notes for VeroCardsV3

## Summary
Document the V3 refactor, structure changes, and any route/import updates so other contributors can adopt patterns consistently.

## Scope
- Update `FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` if needed.
- Add notes on new components/hooks, folder structure, and lazy-loading.

## Tasks
- Write migration steps from V2 → V3.
- Add guidance for adding new card types without bloating the route.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Contributors can implement features using V3 patterns without guessing.
- Docs merged alongside code changes.
- No outdated references to V2 remain in docs.
