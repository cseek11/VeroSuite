## Summary

All identified conflicts with the Two-Brain Model have been resolved.

---

## Files Fixed

### ✅ 1. `.cursor/rules.yml` - Archived/Deprecated

**Action:** Marked as deprecated with Two-Brain Model notes  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- Added deprecation notice
- Documented that rules moved to `.cursor/enforcement/rules/`
- Kept for reference only

---

### ✅ 2. `.cursor/context_manager/context_profiles.yaml` - Paths Updated

**Action:** Updated all rule paths to `.cursor/enforcement/rules/`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- All `@.cursor/rules/` → `@.cursor/enforcement/rules/`
- Updated for all task types (edit_code, run_tests, write_docs, etc.)
- Updated dependencies section

---

### ✅ 3. `.cursor/scripts/auto-enforcer.py` - Step 0.5/4.5 Removed

**Action:** Removed Step 0.5/4.5 instructions from all three methods  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Methods Updated:**
- `_generate_minimal_recommendations()` - Removed Step 0.5/4.5
- `_generate_recommendations_file()` - Removed Step 0.5/4.5
- `_generate_dynamic_rule_file()` - Removed Step 0.5/4.5

**Changes:**
- Replaced Step 0.5/4.5 instructions with Two-Brain Model notes
- Added note that context management is handled by enforcer (Brain A)
- LLM (Brain B) doesn't need to manage context

---

### ✅ 4. `.cursor/enforcement/rules/context/context-schema_prisma.mdc` - Updated

**Action:** Removed Step 0.5/4.5 references  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- Removed Step 0.5/4.5 from task start/end sections
- Added Two-Brain Model note
- Updated paths to `.cursor/enforcement/rules/`

---

### ✅ 5. `.cursor/context_manager/context_state.json` - Reset

**Action:** Reset to empty state  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- Cleared active context
- Cleared preloaded context
- Will be repopulated by enforcer with correct paths

---

### ✅ 6. `.cursorrules.two-brain` - Deleted

**Action:** Deleted backup file  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- File was a backup of `.cursorrules`
- No longer needed (`.cursorrules` already updated)

---

## Remaining Auto-Generated Files

These files are auto-generated by the enforcer and will be updated on next run:

- `.cursor/context_manager/recommendations.md` - Will be regenerated without Step 0.5/4.5
- `.cursor/context_manager/dashboard.md` - Will be regenerated with correct paths

**Note:** These will automatically use the updated enforcer code and correct paths.

---

## Verification

### What Was Fixed:

1. ✅ All rule paths updated to `.cursor/enforcement/rules/`
2. ✅ Step 0.5/4.5 instructions removed from all generated files
3. ✅ Context management clarified as enforcer-only (Brain A)
4. ✅ LLM (Brain B) no longer instructed to manage context
5. ✅ Backup files cleaned up

### Expected Behavior:

- **LLM (Brain B):** Only loads 3-4 lightweight files from `.cursor/rules/`
- **Enforcer (Brain A):** Manages all context and heavy rules
- **No Step 0.5/4.5:** LLM doesn't see Single-Brain Model instructions
- **Correct Paths:** All references point to `.cursor/enforcement/rules/`

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All fixes complete
2. ⏳ Test that LLM only loads lightweight files
3. ⏳ Verify enforcer generates correct recommendations
4. ⏳ Monitor for any remaining conflicts
